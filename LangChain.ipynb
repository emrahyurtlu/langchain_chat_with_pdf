The lack of effective prac-\\ntices leads to unpredictability, repeated error, and wasted effort. Customers are disappointed by slipping schedules,\\ngrowing budgets, and poor quality. Developers are disheartened by working ever longer hours to produce ever\\npoorer software. \\nOnce we have experienced such a ﬁasco, we become afraid of repeating the experience. Our fears motivate\\nus to create a process that constrains our activities and demands certain outputs and artifacts. We draw these con-\\nstraints and outputs from past experience, choosing things that appeared to work well in previous projects. Our\\nhope is that they will work again and take away our fears.\\nHowever, projects are not so simple that a few constraints and artifacts can reliably prevent error. As errors\\ncontinue to be made, we diagnose those errors and put in place even more constraints and artifacts in order to pre-\\nvent those errors in the future. After many, projects we may ﬁnd ourselves overloaded with a huge cumbersome\\nprocess that greatly impedes our ability to get anything done. \\nA big cumbersome process can create the very problems that it is designed to prevent. It can slow the team to\\nthe extent that schedules slip and budgets bloat. It can reduce responsiveness of the team to the point where they\\nFrom Chapter 1 of Agile Software Development, Principles, Patterns, and Practices, First Edition. Robert C.

Unfortunately, this leads many teams to believe that they don’t have\\nenough process. So, in a kind of runaway-process inﬂation, they make their process ever larger.\\nRunaway-process inﬂation is a good description of the state of affairs in many software companies circa\\n2000 A.D. Though there were still many teams operating without a process, the adoption of very large, heavy-\\nweight processes is rapidly growing, especially in large corporations. (See Appendix C.)\\nThe Agile Alliance\\nIn early 2001, motivated by the observation that software teams in many corporations were stuck in a quagmire of\\never-increasing process, a group of industry experts met to outline the values and principles that would allow soft-\\nware teams to work quickly and respond to change. They called themselves the Agile Alliance.1 Over the next sev-\\neral months, they worked to create a statement of values. The result was The Manifesto of the Agile Alliance. \\nThe Manifesto of the Agile Alliance\\nManifesto for Agile Software Development\\nWe are uncovering better ways of developing \\nsoftware by doing it and helping others do it. \\nThrough this work we have come to value\\n•Individuals and interactions over processes and tools \\n•Working software over comprehensive documentation \\n•Customer collaboration over contract negotiation \\n•Responding to change over following a plan \\nThat is, while there is value in the items on \\nthe right, we value the items on the left more. \\nKent Beck Mike Beedle Arie van Bennekum Alistair Cockburn\\nWard Cunningham Martin Fowler James Grenning Jim Highsmith\\nAndrew Hunt Ron Jeffries Jon Kern Brian Marick\\nRobert C. Martin Steve Mellor Ken Schwaber Jeff Sutherland\\nDave Thomas\\nIndividuals and interactions over processes and tools. People are the most important ingredient of suc-\\ncess. A good process will not save the project from failure if the team doesn’t have strong players, but a bad pro-\\ncess can make even the strongest of players ineffective. Even a group of strong players can fail badly if they don’t\\nwork as a team. \\nA strong player is not necessarily an ace programmer. A strong player may be an average programmer, but\\nsomeone who works well with others. Working well with others, communicating and interacting, is more impor-\\ntant than raw programming talent. A team of average programmers who communicate well are more likely to suc-\\nceed than a group of superstars who fail to interact as a team.\\nThe right tools can be very important to success. Compilers, IDEs, source-code control systems, etc. are all\\nvital to the proper functioning of a team of developers. However, tools can be overemphasized. An overabundance\\nof big, unwieldy tools is just as bad as a lack of tools.\\nMy advice is to start small. Don’t assume you’ve outgrown a tool until you’ve tried it and found you can’t\\nuse it. Instead of buying the top-of-the-line, megaexpensive, source-code control system, ﬁnd a free one and use it\\n1. agilealliance.org\\n4\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

Before you buy team licenses for the best of all CASE tools,\\nuse white boards and graph paper until you can reasonably show that you need more. Before you commit to the\\ntop-shelf behemoth database system, try ﬂat ﬁles. Don’t assume that bigger and better tools will automatically help\\nyou do better. Often they hinder more than they help.\\nRemember, building the team is more important than building the environment. Many teams and managers\\nmake the mistake of building the environment ﬁrst and expecting the team to gel automatically. Instead, work to\\ncreate the team, and then let the team conﬁgure the environment on the basis of need.\\nWorking software over comprehensive documentation. Software without documentation is a disaster.\\nCode is not the ideal medium for communicating the rationale and structure of a system. Rather, the team needs to\\nproduce human-readable documents that describe the system and the rationale for their design decisions. \\nHowever, too much documentation is worse than too little. Huge software documents take a great deal of\\ntime to produce and even more time to keep in sync with the code. If they are not kept in sync, then they turn into\\nlarge, complicated lies and become a signiﬁcant source of misdirection.\\nIt is always a good idea for the team to write and maintain a rationale and structure document, but that docu-\\nment needs to be short and salient. By “short,” I mean one or two dozen pages at most. By “salient,” I mean it\\nshould discuss the overall design rationale and only the highest-level structures in the system.\\nIf all we have is a short rationale and structure document, how do we train new team members to work on the\\nsystem? We work closely with them. We transfer our knowledge to them by sitting next to them and helping them.\\nWe make them part of the team through close training and interaction.\\nThe two documents that are the best at transferring information to new team members are the code and the\\nteam. The code does not lie about what it does. It may be hard to extract rationale and intent from the code, but\\nthe code is the only unambiguous source of information. The team members hold the ever-changing road map of\\nthe system in their heads. There is no faster and more efﬁcient way to transfer that road map to others than human-\\nto-human interaction.\\nMany teams have gotten hung up in the pursuit of documentation instead of software. This is often a fatal\\nﬂaw. There is a simple rule called Martin’s ﬁrst law of documentation that prevents it:\\nProduce no document unless its need is immediate and signiﬁcant.\\nCustomer collaboration over contract negotiation. Software cannot be ordered like a commodity. You\\ncannot write a description of the software you want and then have someone develop it on a ﬁxed schedule for a\\nﬁxed price. Time and time again, attempts to treat software projects in this manner have failed. Sometimes the fail-\\nures are spectacular.\\nIt is tempting for the managers of a company to tell their development staff what their needs are, and then\\nexpect that staff to go away for a while and return with a system that satisﬁes those needs. However, this mode of\\noperation leads to poor quality and failure. \\nSuccessful projects involve customer feedback on a regular and frequent basis. Rather than depending on a\\ncontract or a statement of work, the customer of the software works closely with the development team, providing\\nfrequent feedback on their efforts.\\nA contract that speciﬁes the requirements, schedule, and cost of a project is fundamentally ﬂawed. In most\\ncases, the terms it speciﬁes become meaningless long before the project is complete. 2 The best contracts are those\\nthat govern the way the development team and the customer will work together. \\nAs an example of a successful contract, take one I negotiated in 1994 for a large, multiyear, half-million-line\\nproject. We, the development team, were paid a relatively low monthly rate. Large payouts were made to us when\\nwe delivered certain large blocks of functionality.

We released the software to him\\nalmost every Friday. By Monday or Tuesday of the following week, he would have a list of changes for us to put\\ninto the software.

The key to this success was the intense collaboration with the customer and a\\ncontract that governed that collaboration rather than trying to specify the details of scope and schedule for a\\nﬁxed cost.\\nResponding to change over following a plan. It is the ability to respond to change that often determines\\nthe success or failure of a software project. When we build plans, we need to make sure that our plans are ﬂexible\\nand ready to adapt to changes in the business and technology.\\nThe course of a software project cannot be planned very far into the future. First of all, the business environ-\\nment is likely to change, causing the requirements to shift. Second, customers are likely to alter the requirements\\nonce they see the system start to function. Finally, even if we know the requirements, and we are sure they won’t\\nchange, we are not very good at estimating how long it will take to develop them.\\nIt is tempting for novice managers to create a nice PERT or Gantt chart of the whole project and tape it to the\\nwall. They may feel that this chart gives them control over the project. They can track the individual tasks and\\ncross them off the chart as they are completed. They can compare the actual dates with the planned dates on the\\nchart and react to any discrepancies.\\nWhat really happens is that the structure of the chart degrades. As the team gains knowledge about the sys-\\ntem, and as the customers gain knowledge about their needs, certain tasks on the chart become unnecessary. Other\\ntasks will be discovered and will need to be added. In short, the plan will undergo changes in shape, not just\\nchanges in dates.\\nA better planning strategy is to make detailed plans for the next two weeks, very rough plans for the next\\nthree months, and extremely crude plans beyond that. We should know the tasks we will be working on for the next\\ntwo weeks. We should roughly know the requirements we will be working on for the next three months. And we\\nshould have only a vague idea what the system will do after a year.\\nThis decreasing resolution of the plan means that we are only investing in a detailed plan for those tasks that\\nare immediate. Once the detailed plan is made, it is hard to change since the team will have a lot of momentum and\\ncommitment. However, since that plan only governs a few weeks’ worth of time, the rest of the plan remains\\nﬂexible.\\nPrinciples\\nThe above values inspired the following 12 principles, which are the characteristics that differentiate a set of agile\\npractices from a heavyweight process:\\n•Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software. \\nThe MIT Sloan Management Review published an analysis of software development practices that help \\ncompanies build high-quality products.3 The article found a number of practices that had a signiﬁcant impact \\non the quality of the ﬁnal system.

The article reported that the less functional the initial delivery, the \\nhigher the quality in the ﬁnal delivery.\\nAnother ﬁnding of this article is a strong correlation between ﬁnal quality and frequent deliveries of \\nincreasing functionality. The more frequent the deliveries, the higher the ﬁnal quality.\\nAn agile set of practices delivers early and often. We strive to deliver a rudimentary system within the \\nﬁrst few weeks of the start of the project. Then, we strive to continue to deliver systems of increasing func-\\ntionality every two weeks.\\nCustomers may choose to put these systems into production if they think that they are functional \\nenough. Or they may choose simply to review the existing functionality and report on changes they want \\nmade. \\n•Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the cus-\\ntomer's competitive advantage. \\nThis is a statement of attitude. The participants in an agile process are not afraid of change. They view \\nchanges to the requirements as good things, because those changes mean that the team has learned more \\nabout what it will take to satisfy the market.\\nAn agile team works very hard to keep the structure of its software ﬂexible so that when requirements \\nchange, the impact to the system is minimal. Later in this book we will learn the principles and patterns of \\nobject-oriented design that help us to maintain this kind of ﬂexibility.\\n•Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the \\nshorter time scale. \\nWe deliver working software, and we delivery it early (after the ﬁrst few weeks) and often (every few \\nweeks thereafter). We are not content with delivering bundles of documents or plans. We don’t count those \\nas true deliveries. Our eye is on the goal of delivering software that satisﬁes the customer’s needs.\\n•Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project. \\nIn order for a project to be agile, there must be signiﬁcant and frequent interaction between the cus-\\ntomers, developers, and stakeholders. A software project is not like a ﬁre-and-forget weapon. A software \\nproject must be continuously guided.\\n•Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust \\nthem to get the job done. \\nAn agile project is one in which people are considered the most important factor of success. All other \\nfactors—process, environment, management, etc.—are considered to be second order effects, and they are \\nsubject to change if they are having an adverse effect upon the people. \\nFor example, if the ofﬁce environment is an obstacle to the team, the ofﬁce environment must be \\nchanged. If certain process steps are an obstacle to the team, the process steps must be changed. \\n•The most efﬁcient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-\\nto-face conversation. \\nIn an agile project, people talk to each other. The primary mode of communication is conversation. \\nDocuments may be created, but there is no attempt to capture all project information in writing. An agile \\nproject team does not demand written specs, written plans, or written designs. Team members may create \\nthem if they perceive an immediate and signiﬁcant need, but they are not the default. The default is \\nconversation.\\n•Working software is the primary measure of progress. \\nAgile projects measure their progress by measuring the amount of software that is currently meeting \\nthe customer’s need. They don’t measure their progress in terms of the phase that they are in or by the vol-\\nume of documentation that has been produced or by the amount of infrastructure code they have created. \\nThey are 30% done when 30% of the necessary functionality is working.\\n7\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir\"),\n",

The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to \\nmaintain a constant pace indeﬁnitely. \\nAn agile project is not run like a 50-yard dash; it is run like a marathon. The team does not take off at \\nfull speed and try to maintain that speed for the duration. Rather, they run at a fast, but sustainable, pace. \\nRunning too fast leads to burnout, shortcuts, and debacle. Agile teams pace themselves. They don’t \\nallow themselves to get too tired. They don’t borrow tomorrow’s energy to get a bit more done today. They \\nwork at a rate that allows them to maintain the highest quality standards for the duration of the project.\\n•Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility. \\nHigh quality is the key to high speed. The way to go fast is to keep the software as clean and robust as \\npossible. Thus, all agile team members are committed to producing only the highest quality code they can. \\nThey do not make messes and then tell themselves they’ll clean it up when they have more time. If they \\nmake a mess, they clean it up before they ﬁnish for the day.\\n•Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.  \\nAgile teams do not try to build the grand system in the sky. Rather, they always take the simplest path \\nthat is consistent with their goals. They don’t put a lot of importance on anticipating tomorrow’s problems, \\nnor do they try to defend against all of them today. Instead, they do the simplest and highest-quality work \\ntoday, conﬁdent that it will be easy to change if and when tomorrow’s problems arise.\\n•The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.\\nAn agile team is a self-organizing team. Responsibilities are not handed to individual team members \\nfrom the outside. Responsibilities are communicated to the team as a whole, and the team determines the \\nbest way to fulﬁll them.\\nAgile team members work together on all aspects of the project. Each is allowed input into the whole. \\nNo single team member is responsible for the architecture or the requirements or the tests. The team shares \\nthose responsibilities, and each team member has inﬂuence over them.\\n•At regular intervals, the team reﬂects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior \\naccordingly.\\nAn agile team continually adjusts its organization, rules, conventions, relationships, etc. An agile team \\nknows that its environment is continuously changing and knows that they must change with that environ-\\nment to remain agile.\\nConclusion\\nThe professional goal of every software developer and every development team is to deliver the highest possible\\nvalue to their employers and customers. And yet our projects fail, or fail to deliver value, at a dismaying rate.\\nThough well intentioned, the upward spiral of process inﬂation is culpable for at least some of this failure. The\\nprinciples and values of agile software development were formed as a way to help teams break the cycle of process\\ninﬂation and to focus on simple techniques for reaching their goals.\\nAt the time of this writing, there were many agile processes to choose from.

The customer of an XP team is the person or group who deﬁnes and prioritizes fea-\\ntures. Sometimes, the customer is a group of business analysts or marketing specialists working in the same com-\\npany as the developers. Sometimes, the customer is a user representative commissioned by the body of users.\\nSometimes the customer is in fact the paying customer. But in an XP project, whoever the customers are, they are\\nmembers of, and available to, the team.\\nThe best case is for the customer to work in the same room as the developers. Next best is if the customer\\nworks in within 100 feet of the developers. The larger the distance, the harder it is for the customer to be a true\\nteam member. If the customer is in another building or another state, it is very difﬁcult to integrate him or her into\\nthe team.\\nWhat do you do if the customer simply cannot be close by? My advice is to ﬁnd someone who can be close\\nby and who is willing and able to stand in for the true customer. \\nUser Stories\\nIn order to plan a project, we must know something about the requirements, but we don’t need to know very much.\\nFor planning purposes, we only need to know enough about a requirement to estimate it. You may think that in\\norder to estimate a requirement you need to know all its details, but that’s not quite true. You have to know that\\nthere are details, and you have to know roughly the kinds of details there are, but you don’t have to know the\\nspeciﬁcs.\\nThe speciﬁc details of a requirement are likely to change with time, especially once the customer begins to\\nsee the system come together. There is nothing that focuses requirements better than seeing the nascent system\\ncome to life. Therefore, capturing the speciﬁc details about a requirement long before it is implemented is likely to\\nresult in wasted effort and premature focusing. \\nWhen using XP, we get the sense of the details of the requirements by talking them over with the customer,\\nbut we do not capture that detail. Rather, the customer writes a few words on an index card that we agree will remind\\nus of the conversation. The developers write an estimate on the card at roughly the same time that the customer\\nwrites it. They base that estimate on the sense of detail they got during their conversations with the customer.\\nA user story is a mnemonic token of an ongoing conversation about a requirement. It is a planning tool that\\nthe customer uses to schedule the implementation of a requirement based upon its priority and estimated cost.\\nShort Cycles\\nAn XP project delivers working software every two weeks.  Each of these two-week iterations produces working\\nsoftware that addresses some of the needs of the stakeholders. At the end of each iteration, the system is demon-\\nstrated to the stakeholders in order to get their feedback.\\nThe Iteration Plan. An iteration is usually two weeks in length. It represents a minor delivery that may or\\nmay not be put into production. It is a collection of user stories selected by the customer according to a budget\\nestablished by the developers. \\nThe developers set the budget for an iteration by measuring how much they got done in the previous itera-\\ntion. The customer may select any number of stories for the iteration, so long as the total of their estimates does\\nnot exceed that budget. \\nOnce an iteration has been started, the customer agrees not to change the deﬁnition or priority of the stories\\nin that iteration. During this time, the developers are free to cut the stories up in to tasks and to develop the tasks in\\nthe order that makes the most technical and business sense.\\nThe Release Plan. XP teams often create a release plan that maps out the next six iterations or so. That\\nplan is known as a release plan. A release is usually three months worth of work. It represents a major delivery that\\ncan usually be put into production. A release plan consists of prioritized collections of user stories that have been\\nselected by the customer according to a budget given by the developers. \\n12\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

The customer also determines the order in which the stories will be implemented in the release. If the\\nteam so desires, they can map out the ﬁrst few iterations of the release by showing which stories will be completed\\nin which iterations.\\nReleases are not cast in stone. The customer can change the content at any time. He or she can cancel stories,\\nwrite new stories, or change the priority of a story.\\nAcceptance Tests\\nThe details about the user stories are captured in the form of acceptance tests speciﬁed by the customer. The accep-\\ntance tests for a story are written immediately preceding, or even concurrent with, the implementation of that story.\\nThey are written in some kind of scripting language that allows them to be run automatically and repeatedly.\\nTogether, they act to verify that the system is behaving as the customers have speciﬁed.\\nThe language of the acceptance tests grows and evolves with the system. The customers may recruit the\\ndevelopers to create a simple scripting system, or they may have a separate quality assurance (QA) department that\\ncan develop it. Many customers enlist the help of QA in developing the acceptance-testing tool and with writing\\nthe acceptance tests themselves. \\nOnce an acceptance test passes, it is added to the body of passing acceptance tests and is never allowed to\\nfail again. This growing body of acceptance tests is run several times per day, every time the system is built. If an\\nacceptance tests fails, the build is declared a failure. Thus, once a requirement is implemented, it is never broken.\\nThe system migrates from one working state to another and is never allowed to be inoperative for longer than a few\\nhours.\\nPair Programming\\nAll production code is written by pairs of programmers working together at the same workstation. One member of\\neach pair drives the keyboard and types the code. The other member of the pair watches the code being typed,\\nlooking for errors and improvements.1 The two interact intensely. Both are completely engaged in the act of writ-\\ning software.\\nThe roles change frequently. The driver may get tired or stuck, and his pair partner will grab the keyboard\\nand start to drive. The keyboard will move back and forth between them several times in an hour. The resultant\\ncode is designed and authored by both members. Neither can take more than half the credit.\\nPair membership changes at least once per day so that every programmer works in two different pairs each\\nday. Over the course of an iteration, every member of the team should have worked with every other member of the\\nteam, and they should have worked on just about everything that was going on in the iteration.\\nThis dramatically increases the spread of knowledge through the team. While specialties remain and tasks\\nthat require certain specialties will usually belong to the appropriate specialists, those specialists will pair with\\nnearly everyone else on the team. This will spread the specialty out through the team such that other team mem-\\nbers can ﬁll in for the specialists in a pinch.\\nStudies by Laurie Williams 2 and Nosek 3 have suggested that pairing does not reduce the efﬁciency of the\\nprogramming staff, yet it signiﬁcantly reduces the defect rate.\\n1.

The following paragraphs provide\\na quick overview.\\nAll production code is written in order to make failing unit tests pass. First we write a unit test that fails\\nbecause the functionality for which it is testing doesn’t exist. Then we write the code that makes that test pass. \\nThis iteration between writing test cases and code is very rapid, on the order of a minute or so. The test cases\\nand code evolve together, with the test cases leading the code by a very small fraction. (See “A Programming Epi-\\nsode” in Chapter 6 for an example.)\\nAs a result, a very complete body of test cases grows along with the code. These tests allow the programmers\\nto check whether the program works. If a pair makes a small change, they can run the tests to ensure that they\\nhaven’t broken anything. This greatly facilitates refactoring (discussed later).\\nWhen you write code in order to make test cases pass, that code is, by deﬁnition, testable. In addition, there\\nis a strong motivation to decouple modules from each other so that they can be independently tested. Thus, the\\ndesign of code that is written in this fashion tends to be much less coupled. The principles of object-oriented\\ndesign play a powerful role in helping you with this decoupling.4\\nCollective Ownership\\nA pair has the right to check out any module and improve it. No programmers are individually responsible for any\\none particular module or technology. Everybody works on the GUI.5 Everybody works on the middleware. Every-\\nbody works on the database. Nobody has more authority over a module or a technology than anybody else.\\nThis doesn’t mean that XP denies specialties. If your specialty is the GUI, you are most likely to work on\\nGUI tasks, but you will also be asked to pair on middleware and database tasks. If you decide to learn a second\\nspecialty, you can sign up for tasks and work with specialists who will teach it to you. You are not conﬁned to your\\nspecialty.\\nContinuous Integration\\nThe programmers check in their code and integrate several times per day. The rule is simple. The ﬁrst one to check\\nin wins, everybody else merges.\\nXP teams use nonblocking source control. This means that programmers are allowed to check any module\\nout at any time, regardless of who else may have it checked out. When the programmer checks the module back in\\nafter modifying it, he must be prepared to merge it with any changes made by anyone who checked the module in\\nahead of him. To avoid long merge sessions, the members of the team check in their modules very frequently.\\nA pair will work for an hour or two on a task. They create test cases and production code. At some conve-\\nnient breaking point, probably long before the task is complete, the pair decides to check the code back in. They\\nﬁrst make sure that all the tests run. They integrate their new code into the existing code base. If there is a merge to\\ndo, they do it. If necessary, they consult with the programmers who beat them to the check in. Once their changes\\nare integrated, they build the new system. They run every test in the system, including all currently running accep-\\ntance tests. If they broke anything that used to work, they ﬁx it. Once all the tests run, they ﬁnish the check in. \\nThus, XP teams will build the system many times each day. They build the whole system from end to end.6 If\\nthe ﬁnal result of a system is a CD, they cut the CD. If the ﬁnal result of the system is an active Web site, they\\ninstall that Web site, probably on a testing server.\\n4. See Section II.\\n5. I’m not advocating a three-tiered architecture here. I just chose three common partitions of software technology.\\n6. Ron Jeffries says, “End to end is farther than you think.”\\n14\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

There are tables set up with workstations on them. Each table has two\\nor three such workstations. There are two chairs in front of each workstation for pairs to sit in. The walls are cov-\\nered with status charts, task breakdowns, UML diagrams, etc. \\nThe sound in this room is a low buzz of conversation. Each pair is within earshot of every other.

Moreover,\\ninstead of interfering with productivity, a University of Michigan study suggested that working in a “war room”\\nenvironment may increase productivity by a factor of two.7\\nThe Planning Game\\nThe next chapter, “Planning,” goes into great detail about the XP\\nplanning game. I’ll describe it brieﬂy here.\\nThe essence of the planning game is the division of responsi-\\nbility between business and development. The business people (a.k.a.\\nthe customers) decide how important a feature is, and the developers\\ndecide how much that feature will cost to implement.\\nAt the beginning of each release and each iteration, the devel-\\nopers give the customers a budget, based on how much they were\\nable to get done in the last iteration or in the last release. The customers choose stories whose costs total up to, but\\ndo not exceed that budget.\\nWith these simple rules in place, and with short iterations and frequent releases, it won’t be long before the\\ncustomers and developers get used to the rhythm of the project. The customers will get a sense for how fast the\\ndevelopers are going. Based on that sense, the customers will be able to determine how long their project will take\\nand how much it will cost.\\nSimple Design\\nAn XP team makes their designs as simple and expressive as they can be. Furthermore, they narrow their focus to\\nconsider only the stories that are planned for the current iteration. They don’t worry about stories to come. Instead,\\nthey migrate the design of the system, from iteration to iteration, to be the best design for the stories that the sys-\\ntem currently implements.\\nThis means that an XP team will probably not start with infrastructure. They probably won’t select the data-\\nbase ﬁrst. They probably won’t select the middleware ﬁrst. The team’s ﬁrst act will be to get the ﬁrst batch of sto-\\nries working in the simplest way possible. The team will only add the infrastructure when a story comes along that\\nforces them to do so.\\n7. http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2000/12/001206144705.htm\\n15\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

XP teams always try to ﬁnd the simplest pos-\\nsible design option for the current batch of stories. If we can make the current stories work with ﬂat ﬁles, we might\\nnot use a database or EJB. If we can make the current stories work with a simple socket connection, we might not\\nuse an ORB or RMI. If we can make the current stories work without multithreading, we might not include\\nmutithreading. We try to consider the simplest way to implement the current stories. Then we choose a solution\\nthat is as close to that simplicity as we can practically get.\\nYou Aren’t Going to Need It. Yeah, but we know we’re going to need that database one day. We know\\nwe’re going to need an ORB one day. We know we’re going to have to support multiple users one day. So we need\\nto put the hooks in for those things now, don’t we? \\nAn XP team seriously considers what will happen if they resist the temptation to add infrastructure before it\\nis strictly needed. They start from the assumption that they aren’t going to need that infrastructure. The team puts\\nin the infrastructure, only if they have proof, or at least very compelling evidence, that putting in the infrastructure\\nnow will be more cost effective than waiting.\\nOnce and Only Once. XPers don’t tolerate code duplication. Wherever they ﬁnd it, they eliminate it. \\nThere are many sources of code duplication. The most obvious are those stretches of code that were captured\\nwith a mouse and plopped down in multiple places. When we ﬁnd those, we eliminate them by creating a function\\nor a base class. Sometimes two or more algorithms may be remarkably similar, and yet they differ in subtle ways.\\nWe turn those into functions or employ the TEMPLATE METHOD pattern.8 Whatever the source of duplication, once\\ndiscovered, we won’t tolerate it.\\nThe best way to eliminate redundancy is to create abstractions. After all, if two things are similar, there must\\nbe some abstraction that uniﬁes them. Thus, the act of eliminating redundancy forces the team to create many\\nabstractions and further reduce coupling.\\nRefactoring9\\nI cover this topic in more detail in Chapter 5. What follows is a brief overview.\\nCode tends to rot. As we add feature after feature and deal with bug after bug, the structure of the code\\ndegrades. Left unchecked, this degradation leads to a tangled, unmaintainable mess.\\nXP teams reverse this degradation through frequent refactoring. Refactoring is the practice of making a\\nseries of tiny transformations that improve the structure of the system without affecting its behavior. Each transfor-\\nmation is trivial, hardly worth doing. But together, they combine into signiﬁcant transformations of the design and\\narchitecture of the system. \\nAfter each tiny transformation, we run the unit tests to make sure we haven’t broken anything. Then we do\\nthe next transformation and the next and the next, running the tests after each. In this manner we keep the system\\nworking while transforming its design.\\nRefactoring is done continuously rather than at the end of the project, the end of the release, the end of the\\niteration, or even the end of the day. Refactoring is something we do every hour or every half hour. Through refac-\\ntoring, we continuously keep the code as clean, simple, and expressive as possible. \\nMetaphor\\nMetaphor is the least understood of all the practices of XP. XPers are pragmatists at heart, and this lack of concrete\\ndeﬁnition makes us uncomfortable. Indeed, the proponents of XP have often discussed removing metaphor as a\\npractice. And yet, in some sense, metaphor is one of the most important practices of all.\\n8. See Chapter 14, “Template Method & Strategy: Inheritance v. Delegation.”\\n9.

How do you know how the pieces go together? Clearly, each piece abuts others,\\nand its shape must be perfectly complimentary to the pieces it touches. If you were blind and you had a very good\\nsense of touch, you could put the puzzle together by diligently sifting through each piece and trying it in position\\nafter position. \\nBut there is something more powerful than the shape of the pieces binding the puzzle together. There is a\\npicture. The picture is the true guide. The picture is so powerful that if two adjacent pieces of the picture do not\\nhave complementary shapes, then you know that the puzzle maker made a mistake.\\nThat is the metaphor. It’s the big picture that ties the whole system together. It’s the vision of the system that\\nmakes the location and shape of all the individual modules obvious. If a module’s shape is inconsistent with the\\nmetaphor, then you know it is the module that is wrong.\\nOften a metaphor boils down to a system of names. The names provide a vocabulary for elements in the sys-\\ntem and help to deﬁne their relationships. \\nFor example, I once worked on a system that transmitted text to a screen at 60 characters per second. At that\\nrate, a screen ﬁll could take some time. So we’d allow the program that was generating the text to ﬁll a buffer.\\nWhen the buffer was full, we’d swap the program out to disk. When the buffer got close to empty, we’d swap the\\nprogram back in and let it run more.\\nWe spoke about this system in terms of dump trucks hauling garbage. The buffers were little trucks. The dis-\\nplay screen was the dump. The program was the garbage producer. The names all ﬁt together and helped us think\\nabout the system as a whole. \\nAs another example, I once worked on a system that analyzed network trafﬁc. Every thirty minutes, it would\\npoll dozens of network adapters and pull down the monitoring data from them. Each network adapter gave us a\\nsmall block of data composed of several individual variables. We called these blocks “slices.” The slices were raw\\ndata that needed to be analyzed. The analysis program “cooked” the slices, so it was called “The Toaster.” We\\ncalled the individual variables within the slices, “crumbs.” All in all, it was a useful and entertaining metaphor.\\nConclusion\\nExtreme programming is a set of simple and concrete practices that combines into an agile development process.\\nThat process has been used on many teams with good results.\\nXP is a good general-purpose method for developing software. Many project teams will be able to adopt it as\\nis. Many others will be able to adapt it by adding or modifying practices. \\nBibliography\\n1. Dahl, Dijkstra. Structured Programming.

However, they don’t try to identify all user stories. As the project proceeds, the customers will continue to\\nwrite new user stories. The ﬂow of user stories will not shut off until the project is over.\\nThe developers work together to estimate the stories. The estimates are relative, not absolute. We write a\\nnumber of “points” on a story card to represent the relative cost of the story. We may not be sure just how much\\ntime a story point represents, but we do know that a story with eight points will take twice as long as a story with\\nfour points. \\nSpiking, Splitting, and Velocity\\nStories that are too large or too small are hard to estimate. Developers tend to underestimate large stories and over-\\nestimate small ones. Any story that is too big should be split into pieces that aren’t too big. Any story that is too\\nsmall should be merged with other small stories. \\nFor example, consider the story, “Users can securely transfer money into, out of, and between their\\naccounts.” This is a big story. Estimating will be hard and probably inaccurate. However, we can split it as follow,\\ninto many stories that are much easier to estimate:\\n•Users can log in.\\n•Users can log out.\\n•Users can deposit money into their account.\\n•Users can withdraw money from their account.\\n•Users can transfer money from their account to another account.\\nWhen a story is split or merged, it should be reestimated. It is not wise to simply add or subtract the estimate.\\nThe main reason to split or merge a story is to get it to a size where estimation is accurate. It is not surprising to\\nﬁnd that a story estimated at ﬁve points breaks up into stories that add up to ten! Ten is the more accurate estimate.\\nRelative estimates don’t tell us the absolute size of the stories, so they don’t help us determine when to split\\nor merge them. In order to know the true size of a story, we need a factor that we call velocity. If we have an accu-\\nrate velocity, we can multiply the estimate of any story by the velocity to get the actual time estimate for that story.\\nFor example, if our velocity is “2 days per story point,” and we have a story with a relative estimate of four points,\\nthen the story should take eight days to implement. \\nAs the project proceeds, the measure of velocity will become ever more accurate because we’ll be able to\\nmeasure the number of story points completed per iteration. However, the developers will probably not have a very\\ngood idea of their velocity at the start. They must create an initial guess by whatever means they feel will give the\\nbest results. The need for accuracy at this point is not particularly grave, so they don’t need to spend an inordinate\\namount of time on it. Often, it is sufﬁcient to spend a few days prototyping a story or two to get an idea of the\\nteam’s velocity. Such a prototype session is called a spike.\\nRelease Planning\\nGiven a velocity, the customers can get an idea of the cost of each of the stories. They also know the business value\\nand priority of each story. This allows them to choose the stories they want done ﬁrst. This choice is not purely a\\nmatter of priority. Something that is important, but also expensive, may be delayed in favor of something that is\\nless important but much less expensive. Choices like this are business decisions. The business folks decide which\\nstories give them the most bang for the buck.\\nThe developers and customers agree on a date for the ﬁrst release of the project. This is usually a matter of\\n2–4 months in the future. The customers pick the stories they want implemented within that release and the rough\\n20\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

The customers cannot choose more stories than will ﬁt according to\\nthe current velocity. Since the velocity is initially inaccurate, this selection is crude. But accuracy is not very\\nimportant at this point in time. The release plan can be adjusted as velocity becomes more accurate.\\nIteration Planning\\nNext, the developers and customers choose an iteration size. This is typically two weeks long. Once again, the cus-\\ntomers choose the stories that they want implemented in the ﬁrst iteration. They cannot choose more stories than\\nwill ﬁt according to the current velocity. \\nThe order of the stories within the iteration is a technical decision. The developers implement the stories in\\nthe order that makes the most technical sense. They may work on the stories serially, ﬁnishing each one after the\\nnext, or they may divvy up the stories and work on them all concurrently. It’s entirely up to them.\\nThe customers cannot change the stories in the iteration once the iteration has begun. They are free to change\\nor reorder any other story in the project, but not the ones that the developers are currently working on. \\nThe iteration ends on the speciﬁed date, even if all the stories aren’t done . The estimates for all the com-\\npleted stories are totaled, and the velocity for that iteration is calculated. This measure of velocity is then used to\\nplan the next iteration. The rule is very simple. The planned velocity for each iteration is the measured velocity of\\nthe previous iteration. If the team got 31 story points done last iteration, then they should plan to get 31 story\\npoints done in the next. Their velocity is 31 points per iteration.\\nThis feedback of velocity helps to keep the planning in sync with the team. If the team gains in expertise and\\nskill, the velocity will rise commensurately. If someone is lost from the team, the velocity will fall. If an architec-\\nture evolves that facilitates development, the velocity will rise. \\nTask Planning\\nAt the start of a new iteration, the developers and customers get together to plan. The developers break the stories\\ndown into development tasks. A task is something that one developer can implement in 4–16 hours. The stories are\\nanalyzed, with the customers’ help, and the tasks are enumerated as completely as possible.\\nA list of the tasks is created on a ﬂip chart, whiteboard, or some other convenient medium. Then, one by one,\\nthe developers sign up for the tasks they want to implement. As each developer signs up for a task, he or she esti-\\nmates that task in arbitrary task points.7\\nDevelopers may sign up for any kind of task. Database guys are not constrained to sign up for database\\ntasks. GUI guys can sign up for database tasks if they like. This may seem inefﬁcient, but as you’ll see, there is a\\nmechanism that manages this. The beneﬁt is obvious. The more the developers know about the whole project, the\\nhealthier and more informed the project team is. We want knowledge of the project to spread through the team irre-\\nspective of specialty.\\nEach developer knows how many task points he or she managed to implement in the last iteration. This num-\\nber is their personal budget. No one signs up for more points than they have in their budget. \\nTask selection continues until either all tasks are assigned or all developers have used their budgets. If there\\nare tasks remaining, then the developers negotiate with each other, trading tasks based on their various skills. If\\nthis doesn’t make enough room to get all the tasks assigned, then the developers ask the customers to remove tasks\\nor stories from the iteration. If all the tasks are signed up and the developers still have room in their budgets for\\nmore work, they ask the customers for more stories.\\n7. Many developers find it helpful to use “perfect programming hours” as their task points.\\n21\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

At this\\npoint, half of the stories scheduled for the iteration should be\\ncomplete. If half the stories aren’t complete, then the team tries\\nto reapportion tasks and responsibilities to ensure that all the sto-\\nries will be complete by the end of the iteration. If the developers\\ncannot ﬁnd such a reapportionment, then the customers need to\\nbe told. The customers may decide to pull a task or story from\\nthe iteration. At the very least, they will name the lowest priority\\ntasks and stories so that the developers avoid working on them.\\nFor example, suppose the customers selected eight stories totalling 24 story points for the iteration. Suppose\\nalso that these were broken down into 42 tasks. At the halfway point of the iteration, we would expect to have 21\\ntasks and 12 story points complete. Those 12 story points must represent wholly completed stories. Our goal is to\\ncomplete stories, not just tasks. The nightmare scenario is to get to the end of the iteration with 90% of the tasks\\ncomplete, but no stories complete. At the halfway point, we want to see completed stories that represent half the\\nstory points for the iteration.\\nIterating\\nEvery two weeks, the current iteration ends and the next begins. At the end of each iteration, the current running\\nexecutable is demonstrated to the customers. The customers are asked to evaluate the look, feel, and performance\\nof the project. They will provide their feedback in terms of new user stories.\\nThe customers see progress frequently. They can measure velocity. They can predict how fast the team is\\ngoing, and they can schedule high-priority stories early. In short, they have all the data and control they need to\\nmanage the project to their liking.\\nConclusion\\nFrom iteration to iteration and release to release, the project falls into a predictable and comfortable rhythm.\\nEveryone knows what to expect and when to expect it. Stakeholders see progress frequently and substantially.\\nRather than being shown notebooks full of diagrams and plans, they are shown working software that they can\\ntouch, feel, and provide feedback on. \\nDevelopers see a reasonable plan based upon their own estimates and controlled by their own measured\\nvelocity. They choose the tasks on which they feel comfortable working and keep the quality of their workmanship\\nhigh.\\nManagers receive data every iteration. They use this data to control and manage the project. They don’t have\\nto resort to pressure, threats, or appeals to loyalty to meet an arbitrary and unrealistic date.\\nIf this sounds like blue sky and apple pie, it’s not. The stakeholders won’t always be happy with the data that\\nthe process produces, especially not at ﬁrst. Using an agile method does not mean that the stakeholders will get\\nwhat they want. It simply means that they’ll be able to control the team to get the most business value for the least\\ncost. \\nBibliography\\n1. Beck, Kent. Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change.

Designing the\\nprogram to be callable and testable is remarkably important. In order to be callable and testable, the software has\\nto be decoupled from its surroundings. Thus, the act of writing tests ﬁrst forces us to decouple the software! \\nAnother important effect of writing tests ﬁrst is that the tests act as an invaluable form of documentation. If\\nyou want to know how to call a function or create an object, there is a test that shows you. The tests act as a suite\\nof examples that help other programmers ﬁgure out how to work with the code. This documentation is compileable\\nand executable. It will stay current. It cannot lie. \\nAn Example of Test-First Design\\nI recently wrote a version of Hunt the Wumpus, just for fun. This program is a simple adventure game in which the\\nplayer moves through a cave trying to kill the Wumpus before the Wumpus eats him. The cave is a set of rooms\\nthat are connected to each other by passageways. Each room may have passages to the north, south, east, or west.\\nThe player moves about by telling the computer which direction to go.\\nOne of the ﬁrst tests I wrote for this program was testMove in Listing 4-1. This function creates a new\\nWumpusGame, connects room 4 to room 5 via an east passage, places the player in room 4, issues the command to\\nmove east, and then asserts that the player should be in room 5.\\nListing 4-1\\npublic void testMove()\\n{\\n  WumpusGame g = new WumpusGame();\\n  g.connect(4,5,\"E\");\\n  g.setPlayerRoom(4);\\n  g.east();\\n  assertEquals(5, g.getPlayerRoom());\\n}\\nAll this code was written before any part of WumpusGame was written. I took Ward Cunningham’s advice\\nand wrote the test the way I wanted it to read. I trusted that I could make the test pass by writing the code that con-\\nformed to the structure implied by the test. This is called intentional programming. You state your intent in a test\\nbefore you implement it, making your intent as simple and readable as possible. You trust that this simplicity and\\nclarity points to a good structure for the program.\\nProgramming by intent immediately led me to an interesting design decision. The test makes no use of a\\nRoom class. The action of connecting one room to another communicates my intent. I don’t seem to need a Room\\nclass to facilitate that communication. Instead, I can just use integers to represent the rooms. \\nThis may seem counter intuitive to you. After all, this program may appear to you to be all about rooms;\\nmoving between rooms; ﬁnding out what rooms contain; etc. Is the design implied by my intent ﬂawed because it\\nlacks a Room class?\\nI could argue that the concept of connections is far more central to the Wumpus game than the concept of\\nroom. I could argue that this initial test pointed out a good way to solve the problem. Indeed, I think that is the\\ncase, but it is not the point I’m trying to make. The point is that the test illuminated a central design issue at a very\\nearly stage. The act of writing tests ﬁrst is an act of discerning between design decisions.\\n24\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

Most of us could easily write the four named methods\\nof WumpusGame from this simple speciﬁcation. We could also name and write the three other direction commands\\nwithout much trouble. If later we want to know how to connect two rooms or move in a particular direction, this\\ntest will show us how to do it in no uncertain terms. This test acts as a compileable and executable document that\\ndescribes the program.\\nTest Isolation\\nThe act of writing tests before production code often exposes areas in the software that ought to be decoupled. For\\nexample, Figure 4-1 shows a simple UML diagram 1 of a payroll application. The Payroll class uses the\\nEmployeeDatabase class to fetch an Employee object. It asks the Employee to calculate its pay. Then it passes\\nthat pay to the CheckWriter object to produce a check. Finally, it posts the payment to the Employee object and\\nwrites the object back to the database. \\nPresume that we haven’t written any of this code yet. So far, this diagram is just sitting on a whiteboard after\\na quick design session.2 Now, we need to write the tests that specify the behavior of the Payroll object. There are\\na number of problems associated with writing these tests. First, what database do we use? Payroll needs to read\\nfrom some kind of database. Must we write a fully functioning database before we can test the Payroll class?\\nWhat data do we load into it? Second, how do we verify that the appropriate check got printed? We can’t write an\\nautomated test that looks on the printer for a check and veriﬁes the amount on it!\\nThe solution to these problems is to use the MOCK OBJECT pattern.3 We can insert interfaces between all the\\ncollaborators of Payroll and create test stubs that implement these interfaces.\\nFigure 4-2 shows the structure. The Payroll class now uses interfaces to communicate with the\\nEmployeeDatabase, CheckWriter, and Employee. Three M OCK OBJECTS have been created that implement\\nthese interfaces. These MOCK OBJECTS are queried by the PayrollTest object to see if the Payroll object man-\\nages them correctly. \\nListing 4-2 shows the intent of the test. It creates the appropriate mock objects, passes them to the Payroll\\nobject, tells the Payroll object to pay all the employees, and then asks the mock objects to verify that all the\\nchecks were written correctly and that all the payments were posted correctly.\\n1. If you don’t know UML, there are two appendices that describes it in great detail. See Appendices A and B, starting on page 4 67.\\nFigure 4-1 Coupled Payroll Model\\n2. [Jeffries2001].\\n3.

It’s not\\nactually checking that checks were written. It’s not actually checking that a true database was properly updated.\\nRather, it is checking that the Payroll class is behaving as it should in isolation. \\nYou might wonder what the MockEmployee is for. It seems feasible that the real Employee class could be\\nused instead of a mock. If that were so, then I would have no compunction about using it.

It allows us to swap in different databases and check writers, both for\\nthe purpose of testing and for extension of the application. I think it is interesting that this decoupling was driven\\nby the need to test. Apparently, the need to isolate the module under test forces us to decouple in ways that are ben-\\neﬁcial to the overall structure of the program. Writing tests before code improves our designs.\\nA large part of this book is about design principles for managing dependencies. Those principles give you\\nsome guidelines and techniques for decoupling classes and packages. You will ﬁnd these principles most beneﬁcial\\nif you practice them as part of your unit testing strategy. It is the unit tests that will provide much of the impetus\\nand direction for decoupling. \\nFigure 4-2 Decoupled Payroll using Mock Objects for testing\\nMock\\nCheckWriter\\n«interface»\\nCheckWriter\\nMock\\nEmployeePayrollTest\\nPayroll\\nMock\\nEmployee\\nDatabase\\n+ writeCheck()\\n«interface»\\nEmployee\\n+ calculatePay()\\n+ postPayment()\\n«interface»\\nEmployee\\nDatabase\\n+ getEmployee\\n+ putEmployee\\n26\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

Unit tests ver-\\nify that the small elements of the system work as they are expected to, but\\nthey do not verify that the system works properly as a whole. Unit tests are\\nwhite-box tests 4 that verify the individual mechanisms of the system.\\nAcceptance tests are black-box tests5 that verify that the customer require-\\nments are being met. \\nAcceptance tests are written by folks who do not know the internal\\nmechanisms of the system. They may be written directly by the customer\\nor by some technical people attached to the customer, possibly QA. Accep-\\ntance tests are programs and are therefore executable. However, they are\\nusually written in a special scripting language created for customers of the\\napplication. \\nAcceptance tests are the ultimate documentation of a feature. Once\\nthe customer has written the acceptance tests, which verify that a feature is\\ncorrect, the programmers can read those acceptance tests to truly understand the feature. So, just as unit tests serve\\nas compileable and executable documentation for the internals of the system, acceptance tests serve as com-\\npileable and executable documentation of the features of the system. \\nFurthermore, the act of writing acceptance tests ﬁrst has a profound effect upon the architecture of the sys-\\ntem. In order to make the system testable, it has to be decoupled at the high architecture level. For example, the\\nuser interface (UI) has to be decoupled from the business rules in such a way that the acceptance tests can gain\\naccess to those business rules without going through the UI. \\nIn the early iterations of a project, the temptation is to do acceptance tests manually. This is inadvisable\\nbecause it deprives those early iterations of the decoupling pressure exerted by the need to automate the accep-\\ntance tests. When you start the very ﬁrst iteration, knowing full well that you must automate the acceptance tests,\\nyou make very different architectural trade-offs. And, just as unit tests drive you to make superior design decisions\\nin the small, acceptance tests drive you to make superior architecture decisions in the large.\\nCreating an acceptance testing framework may seem a daunting task. However, if you take only one itera-\\ntion’s worth of features and create only that part of the framework necessary for those few acceptance tests, you’ll\\nﬁnd it’s not that hard to write. You’ll also ﬁnd that the effort is worth the cost.\\nExample of Acceptance Testing\\nConsider, again, the payroll application. In our ﬁrst iteration, we must be able to add and delete employees to and\\nfrom the database. We must also be able to create paychecks for the employees currently in the database. Fortu-\\nnately, we only have to deal with salaried employees. The other kinds of employees have been held back until a\\nlater iteration.\\nWe haven’t written any code yet, and we haven’t invested in any design yet. This is the best time to start\\nthinking about acceptance tests. Once again, intentional programming is a useful tool. We should write the accep-\\ntance tests the way we think they should appear, and then we can structure the scripting language and payroll sys-\\ntem around that structure.\\nI want to make the acceptance tests convenient to write and easy to change. I want them to be placed in a\\nconﬁguration-management tool and saved so that I can run them anytime I please. Therefore, it makes sense that\\nthe acceptance tests should be written in simple text ﬁles. \\n4. A test that knows and depends on the internal structure of the module being tested.\\n5.

His name is “Robert Martin,” and his\\nmonthly pay is $3215.88. Next, we tell the system that it is payday and that it needs to pay all the employees.\\nFinally, we verify that a paycheck was generated for employee 1429 with a GrossPay ﬁeld of $3215.88. \\nClearly, this kind of script will be very easy for customers to write. Also, it will be easy to add new function-\\nality to this kind of script. However, think about what it implies about the structure of the system.\\nThe ﬁrst two lines of the script are functions of the payroll application. We might call these lines payroll\\ntransactions. These are functions that payroll users expect. However, the Verify line is not a transaction that the\\nusers of payroll would expect. This line is a directive that is speciﬁc to the acceptance test.\\nThus, our acceptance testing framework will have to parse this text ﬁle, separating the payroll transactions\\nfrom the acceptance-testing directives. It must send the payroll transactions to the payroll application and then use\\nthe acceptance-testing directives to query the payroll application in order to verify data.\\nThis already puts architectural stress on the payroll program. The payroll program is going to have to accept\\ninput directly from users and also from the acceptance-testing framework. We want to bring those two paths of\\ninput together as early as possible. So, it looks as if the payroll program will need a transaction processor that can\\ndeal with transactions of the form AddEmp and Payday coming from more than one source. We need to ﬁnd some\\ncommon form for those transactions so that the amount of specialized code is kept to a minimum. \\nOne solution would be to feed the transactions into the payroll application in XML. The acceptance-testing\\nframework could certainly generate XML, and it seems likely that the UI of the payroll system could also generate\\nXML. Thus, we might see transactions that looked like the following:\\n<AddEmp PayType=Salaried>\\n  <EmpId>1429</EmpId>\\n  <Name>Robert Martin</Name>\\n  <Salary>3215.88</Salary>\\n</AddEmp>\\nThese transactions might enter the payroll application through a subroutine call, a socket, or even a batch\\ninput ﬁle. Indeed, it would be a trivial matter to change from one to the other during the course of development. So\\nduring the early iterations, we could decide to read transactions from a ﬁle, migrating to an API or socket much\\nlater.\\nHow does the acceptance-test framework invoke the Verify directive? Clearly it must have some way to\\naccess the data produced by the payroll application. Once again, we don’t want the acceptance-testing framework\\nto have to try to read the writing on a printed check, but we can do the next best thing.\\nWe can have the payroll application produce its paychecks in XML. The acceptance-testing framework can\\nthen catch this XML and query it for the appropriate data. The ﬁnal step of printing the check from the XML may\\nbe trivial enough to handle through manual acceptance tests.\\nTherefore, the payroll application can create an XML document that contains all the paychecks. It might\\nlook like this:\\n<Paycheck>\\n  <EmpId>1429</EmpId>\\n  <Name>Robert Martin</Name>\\n  <GrossPay>3215.88</GrossPay>\\n</Paycheck>\\n28\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

For the initial itera-\\ntions, a ﬁle is probably easiest. Therefore, the payroll application will begin its life reading XML transactions in\\nfrom a ﬁle and outputting XML paychecks to a ﬁle. The acceptance-testing framework will read transactions in\\ntext form, translating them to XML and writing them to a ﬁle. It will then invoke the payroll program. Finally, it\\nwill read the output XML from the payroll program and invoke the Verify directives.\\nSerendipitous Architecture\\nNotice the pressure that the acceptance tests placed upon the architecture of the payroll system. The very fact that\\nwe considered the tests ﬁrst led us to the notion of XML input and output very quickly. This architecture has\\ndecoupled the transaction sources from the payroll application. It has also decoupled the paycheck printing mech-\\nanism from the payroll application. These are good architectural decisions.\\nConclusion\\nThe simpler it is to run a suite of tests, the more often those tests will be run. The more the tests are run, the faster\\nany deviation from those tests will be found. If we can run all the tests several times a day, then the system will\\nnever be broken for more than a few minutes. This is a reasonable goal. We simply don’t allow the system to back-\\nslide. Once it works to a certain level, it never backslides to a lower level.\\nYet veriﬁcation is just one of the beneﬁts of writing tests. Both unit tests and acceptance tests are a form of\\ndocumentation. That documentation is compileable and executable; therefore, it is accurate and reliable. More-\\nover, these tests are written in unambiguous languages that are made to be readable by their audience. Program-\\nmers can read unit tests because they are written in their programming language. Customers can read acceptance\\ntests because they are written in a language that they themselves designed. \\nPossibly the most important beneﬁt of all this testing is the impact it has on architecture and design. To make\\na module or an application testable, it must also be decoupled. The more testable it is, the more decoupled it is.\\nThe act of considering comprehensive acceptance and unit tests has a profoundly positive effect upon the structure\\nof the software.\\nBibliography\\n1.

What about the old saw, “if it’s not broken,\\ndon’t ﬁx it!”?\\nEvery software module has three functions. First, there is the function it performs while executing.

Almost all\\nmodules will change in the course of their lives, and it is the responsibility of the developers to make sure that such\\nchanges are as simple as possible to make. A module that is hard to change is broken and needs ﬁxing, even though\\nit works. The third function of a module is to communicate to its readers.

The program also works a bit better. I’m\\npretty pleased with the outcome. The program is much easier to understand and is therefore much easier to change.\\nAlso, the structure of the program has isolated its parts from one another. This also makes the program much easier\\nto change.\\nYou might be worried that extracting functions that are only called once might adversely affect performance.\\nI think the increased readability is worth a few extra nanoseconds in most cases. However, there may be deep inner\\nloops where those few nanoseconds will be costly. My advice is to assume that the cost will be negligible and wait\\nto be proven wrong. \\nWas this worth the time we invested in it? After all, the function worked when we started. I strongly recom-\\nmend that you always practice such refactoring for every module you write and for every module you maintain.\\nThe time investment is very small compared to the effort you’ll be saving yourself and others in the near future. \\nRefactoring is like cleaning up the kitchen after dinner. The ﬁrst time you skip it, you are done with dinner\\nmore quickly. But that lack of clean dishes and clear working space makes dinner take longer to prepare the next\\nday. This makes you want to skip cleaning again. Indeed, you can always ﬁnish dinner faster today if you skip\\ncleaning, but the mess builds and builds. Eventually you are spending an inordinate amount of time hunting for the\\nright cooking utensils, chiseling the encrusted dried food off the dishes, and scrubbing them down so that they are\\nsuitable to cook with. Dinner takes forever. Skipping the cleanup does not really make dinner go faster.\\nThe goal of refactoring, as depicted in this chapter, is to clean your code every day. We don’t want the mess\\nto build. We don’t want to have to chisel and scrub the encrusted bits that accumulate over time. We want to be able\\nto extend and modify our system with a minimum of effort. The most important enabler of that ability is the clean-\\nliness of the code.\\nI can’t stress this enough. All the principles and patterns in this book come to naught if the code they are\\nemployed within is a mess. Before investing in principles and patterns, invest in clean code.\\nBibliography\\n1.

The Frame would have to look at later Frame instances to calculate its score. If those\\nlater Frame instances don’t exist, then it would have to return something ugly, like -1.

Each call to scoreForFrame will just work forward through the array\\nand calculate the score.\\n//Game.java----------------------------------\\npublic class Game\\n{\\n  public int score()\\n  {\\n    return itsScore;\\n  }\\n  public void add(int pins)\\n  {\\n    itsThrows[itsCurrentThrow++]=pins;\\n    itsScore += pins;\\n  }\\n  public int scoreForFrame(int frame)\\n  {\\n    int score = 0;\\n    for ( int ball = 0; \\n      frame > 0 && (ball < itsCurrentThrow); \\n      ball+=2, frame--)\\n    {\\n      score += itsThrows[ball] + itsThrows[ball+1];\\n    }\\n    return score;\\n  }\\n  private int itsScore = 0;\\n  private int[] itsThrows = new int[21];\\n  private int itsCurrentThrow = 0;\\n}\\nRCM: (very satisﬁed with himself) There, that works.\\nRSK: Why the magic number 21?\\nRCM: That’s the maximum possible number of throws in a game.\\nRSK: Yuck. Let me guess, in your youth you were a Unix hacker and prided yourself on writing an entire\\napplication in one statement that nobody else could decipher.\\n scoreForFrame() needs to be refactored to be more communicative.

You mean I should limit the current frame to 11 not 10? I’ll try it.\\nitsCurrentFrame = Math.min(11, itsCurrentFrame);\\nRCM: OK, so now it gets the score correct but fails because the current frame is 11 and not 10. Ick! This\\ncurrent frame thing is a pain in the butt. We want the current frame to be the frame the player is\\nthrowing into, but what does that mean at the end of the game? \\nRSK: Maybe we should go back to the idea that the current frame is the frame of the last ball thrown.\\nRCM: Or maybe we need to come up with the concept of the last completed frame? After all, the score of\\nthe game at any point in time is the score in the last completed frame.\\nRSK: A completed frame is a frame that you can write the score into, right?\\nRCM: Yes, a frame with a spare in it completes after the next ball. A frame with a strike in it completes\\nafter the next two balls. A frame with no mark completes after the second ball in the frame.\\nWait a minute . . . We are trying to get the score() method to work, right? All we need to do is\\nforce score() to call scoreForFrame(10) if the game is complete.\\nRSK: How do we know if the game is complete?\\nRCM: If adjustCurrentFrame ever tries to increment itsCurrentFrame past the tenth frame, then\\nthe game is complete.\\nRSK: Wait. All you are saying is that if getCurrentFrame returns 11, the game is complete. That’s the\\nway the code works now!\\nRCM: Hmm.

Thanks a lot for your help.\\nRSK: No problem, it was fun.\\nConclusion\\nAfter writing this chapter, I published it on the Object Mentor Web site.3 Many people read it and gave their com-\\nments. Some folks were disturbed that there was almost no object-oriented design involved. I ﬁnd this response\\ninteresting. Must we have object-oriented design in every application and every program? Here is a case where the\\nprogram simply didn’t need much of it. The Scorer class was really the only concession to OO, and even that was\\nmore simple partitioning than true OOD.\\nOther folks thought that there really should be a Frame class. One person went so far as to create a version\\nof the program that contained a Frame class. It was much larger and more complex than what you see above.\\nSome folks felt that we weren’t fair to UML. After all, we didn’t do a complete design before we began. The\\nfunny little UML diagram on the back of the napkin (Figure 6-2) was not a complete design. It did not include\\nsequence diagrams. I ﬁnd this argument rather odd. It doesn’t seem likely to me that adding sequence diagrams to\\nFigure 6-2 would have caused us to abandon the Throw and Frame classes. Indeed, I think it would have\\nentrenched us in our view that these classes were necessary.\\nAm I trying to say that diagrams are inappropriate? Of course not. Well, actually, yes, in a way I am. For this\\nprogram, the diagrams didn’t help at all. Indeed, they were a distraction. If we had followed them, we would have\\nwound up with a program that was much more complex than necessary. You might contend that we would also\\n3. http://www.objectmentor.com\\n82\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

The object is to knock down as many pins as possible per throw.\\nThe game is played in ten frames. At the beginning of each frame, all ten pins are set up. The player\\nthen gets two tries to knock them all down.\\nIf the player knocks all the pins down on the ﬁrst try, it is called a “strike,” and the frame ends.\\nIf the player fails to knock down all the pins with his ﬁrst ball, but succeeds with the second ball, it is\\ncalled a “spare.”\\nAfter the second ball of the frame, the frame ends even if there are still pins standing.\\nA strike frame is scored by adding ten, plus the number of pins knocked down by the next two balls, to\\nthe score of the previous frame.\\nA spare frame is scored by adding ten, plus the number of pins knocked down by the next ball, to the\\nscore of the previous frame.\\nOtherwise, a frame is scored by adding the number of pins knocked down by the two balls in the frame\\nto the score of the previous frame.\\nIf a strike is thrown in the tenth frame, then the player may throw two more balls to complete the score\\nof the strike.\\nLikewise, if a spare is thrown in the tenth frame, the player may throw one more ball to complete the\\nscore of the spare.\\nThus, the tenth frame may have three balls instead of two.\\nThe score card above shows a typical, if rather poor, game.\\nIn the ﬁrst frame, the player knocked down 1 pin with his ﬁrst ball and four more with his second.\\nThus, his score for the frame is a ﬁve.\\nIn the second frame, the player knocked down four pins with his ﬁrst ball and ﬁve more with his sec-\\nond. That makes nine pins total, added to the previous frame makes fourteen.\\nIn the third frame, the player knocked down six pins with his ﬁrst ball and knocked down the rest with\\nhis second for a spare. No score can be calculated for this frame until the next ball is rolled.\\n5\\n41\\n14\\n54\\n29\\n6\\n49\\n5\\n60 61\\n10\\n77\\n7\\n97\\n6\\n117 133\\n62\\n83\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

The diagrams\\nrepresenting the source code are ancillary to the design and are not the design itself. As it turns out, Jack’s article\\nwas a harbinger of agile development.\\nIn the pages that follow, we will often talk about “The Design.” You should not take that to mean a set of\\nUML diagrams separate from the code. A set of UML diagrams may represent parts of a design, but it is not the\\ndesign. The design of a software project is an abstract concept. It has to do with the overall shape and structure of\\nthe program as well as the detailed shape and structure of each module, class, and method. It can be represented by\\nmany different media, but its ﬁnal embodiment is source code. In the end, the source code is the design.\\nWhat Goes Wrong with Software?\\nIf you are lucky, you start a project with a clear picture of what you want the system to be. The design of the sys-\\ntem is a vital image in your mind. If you are luckier still, the clarity of that design makes it to the ﬁrst release.\\nThen, something goes wrong. The software starts to rot like a piece of bad meat. As time goes by, the rot\\nspreads and grows. Ugly festering sores and boils accumulate in the code, making it harder and harder to maintain.\\n1.

Though the designers start out with good intentions, they ﬁnd that they are\\nshooting at a moving target. The old system continues to evolve and change, and the new design must keep up. The\\nwarts and ulcers accumulate in the new design before it ever makes it to its ﬁrst release.\\nDesign Smells—The Odors of Rotting Software\\nYou know that the software is rotting when it starts to exhibit any of the following odors:\\n1. Rigidity—The system is hard to change because every change forces many other changes to other parts of the \\nsystem.\\n2. Fragility—Changes cause the system to break in places that have no conceptual relationship to the part that \\nwas changed.\\n3. Immobility—It is hard to disentangle the system into components that can be reused in other systems. \\n4. Viscosity—Doing things right is harder than doing things wrong.\\n5. Needless Complexity—The design contains infrastructure that adds no direct beneﬁt.\\n6. Needless Repetition—The design contains repeating structures that could be uniﬁed under a single abstrac-\\ntion.\\n7. Opacity—It is hard to read and understand. It does not express its intent well.\\nRigidity. Rigidity is the tendency for software to be difﬁcult to change, even in simple ways. A design is\\nrigid if a single change causes a cascade of subsequent changes in dependent modules. The more modules that\\nmust be changed, the more rigid the design. \\nMost developers have faced this situation in one way or another. They are asked to make what appears to be\\na simple change. They look the change over and make a reasonable estimate of the work required. But later, as they\\nwork though the change, they ﬁnd that there are repercussions to the change that they hadn’t anticipated. They ﬁnd\\nthemselves chasing the change through huge portions of the code, modifying far more modules than they had ﬁrst\\nestimated. In the end, the changes take far longer than the initial estimate. When asked why their estimate was so\\npoor they repeat the traditional software developers’ lament, “It was a lot more complicated than I thought!”\\nFragility. Fragility is the tendency of a program to break in many places when a single change is made.\\nOften, the new problems are in areas that have no conceptual relationship with the area that was changed. Fixing\\nthose problems leads to even more problems, and the development team begins to resemble a dog chasing its tail. \\nAs the fragility of a module increases, the likelihood that a change will introduce unexpected problems\\napproaches certainty. This seems absurd, but such modules are not at all uncommon. These are the modules that\\nare constantly in need of repair—the ones that are never off the bug list, the ones that the developers know need to\\nbe redesigned (but nobody wants to face the spectre of redesigning them), the ones that get worse the more you\\nﬁx them. \\nImmobility. A design is immobile when it contains parts that could be useful in other systems, but the\\neffort and risk involved with separating those parts from the original system are too great. This is an unfortunate,\\nbut very common, occurrence.\\nViscosity. Viscosity comes in two forms: viscosity of the software and viscosity of the environment.\\nWhen faced with a change, developers usually ﬁnd more than one way to make that change. Some of the\\nways preserve the design; others do not (i.e., they are hacks.) When the design-preserving methods are harder to\\nemploy than the hacks, the viscosity of the design is high. It is easy to do the wrong thing, but hard to do the right\\nthing. We want to design our software such that the changes that preserve the design are easy to make.\\n88\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

For exam-\\nple, if compile times are very long, developers will be tempted to make changes that don’t force large recompiles,\\neven though those changes don’t preserve the design. If the source-code control system requires hours to check in\\njust a few ﬁles, then developers will be tempted to make changes that require as few check-ins as possible, regard-\\nless of whether the design is preserved.\\nIn both cases, a viscous project is a project in which the design of the software is hard to preserve. We want\\nto create systems and project environments that make it easy to preserve the design.\\nNeedless Complexity. A design contains needless complexity when it contains elements that aren’t cur-\\nrently useful. This frequently happens when developers anticipate changes to the requirements, and put facilities in\\nthe software to deal with those potential changes. At ﬁrst, this may seem like a good thing to do. After all, prepar-\\ning for future changes should keep our code ﬂexible and prevent nightmarish changes later.\\nUnfortunately, the effect is often just the opposite. By preparing for too many contingencies, the design\\nbecomes littered with constructs that are never used. Some of those preparations may pay off, but many more do\\nnot. Meanwhile the design carries the weight of these unused design elements. This makes the software complex\\nand hard to understand.\\nNeedless Repetition. Cut and paste may be useful text-editing operations, but they can be disastrous\\ncode-editing operations. All too often, software systems are built upon dozens or hundreds of repeated code ele-\\nments. It happens like this:\\nRalph needs to write some code that fravles the arvadent. He looks around in other parts of the code where\\nhe suspects other arvadent fravling has occurred and ﬁnds a suitable stretch of code. He cuts and pastes that code\\ninto his module, and he makes the suitable modiﬁcations. \\nUnbeknownst to Ralph, the code he scraped up with his mouse was put there by Todd, who scraped it out of\\na module written by Lilly. Lilly was the ﬁrst to fravle an arvadent, but she realized that fravling an arvadent was\\nvery similar to fravling a garnatosh. She found some code somewhere that fravled a garnatosh, cut and paste it into\\nher module and modiﬁed it as necessary.\\nWhen the same code appears over and over again, in slightly different forms, the developers are missing an\\nabstraction. Finding all the repetition and eliminating it with an appropriate abstraction may not be high on their\\npriority list, but it would go a long way toward making the system easier to understand and maintain.\\nWhen there is redundant code in the system, the job of changing the system can become arduous. Bugs\\nfound in such a repeating unit have to be ﬁxed in every repetition. However, since each repetition is slightly differ-\\nent from every other, the ﬁx is not always the same.\\nOpacity. Opacity is the tendency of a module to be difﬁcult to understand. Code can be written in a clear\\nand expressive manner, or it can be written in an opaque and convoluted manner. Code that evolves over time tends\\nto become more and more opaque with age. A constant effort to keep the code clear and expressive is required in\\norder to keep opacity to a minimum. \\nWhen developers ﬁrst write a module, the code may seem clear to them. That is because they have immersed\\nthemselves within it, and they understand it at an intimate level. Later, after the intimacy has worn off, they may\\nreturn to that module and wonder how they could have written anything so awful. To prevent this, developers need\\nto put themselves in their readers’ shoes and make a concerted effort to refactor their code so that their readers can\\nunderstand it. They also need to have their code reviewed by others.\\nWhat Stimulates the Software to Rot?\\nIn nonagile environments, designs degrade because requirements change in ways that the initial design did not\\nanticipate. Often, these changes need to be made quickly, and they may be made by developers who are not\\n89\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

So, though the change to the design works, it somehow violates the\\noriginal design. Bit by bit, as the changes continue, these violations accumulate, and the design begins to smell. \\nHowever, we cannot blame the drifting of the requirements for the degradation of the design. We, as soft-\\nware developers, know full well that requirements change. Indeed, most of us realize that the requirements are the\\nmost volatile elements in the project. If our designs are failing due to the constant rain of changing requirements, it\\nis our designs and practices that are at fault. We must somehow ﬁnd a way to make our designs resilient to such\\nchanges and employ practices that protect them from rotting.\\nAgile Teams Don’t Allow the Software to Rot\\nAn agile team thrives on change. The team invests little up front; therefore, it is not vested in an aging initial\\ndesign. Rather, they keep the design of the system as clean and simple as possible, and back it up with lots of unit\\ntests and acceptance tests. This keeps the design ﬂexible and easy to change. The team takes advantage of that ﬂex-\\nibility in order to continuously improve the design so that each iteration ends with a system whose design is as\\nappropriate as it can be for the requirements in that iteration.\\nThe “Copy” Program\\nWatching a design rot may help illustrate the above points. Let’s say your boss comes to you early Monday morn-\\ning and asks you to write a program that copies characters from the keyboard to the printer. Doing some quick\\nmental exercises in your head, you come to the conclusion that this will be less than ten lines of code. Design and\\ncoding time should be a lot less than one hour. What with cross-functional group meetings, quality education\\nmeetings, daily group progress meetings, and the three current crises in the ﬁeld, this program ought to take you\\nabout a week to complete—if you stay after hours. However, you always multiply your estimates by three.\\n“Three weeks,” you tell your boss. He harumphs and walks away, leaving you to your task.\\nThe Initial Design. You have a bit of time right now before that process review meeting begins, so you\\ndecide to map out a design for the program. Using structured design you come up with the structure chart in\\nFigure 7-1.\\nThere are three modules, or subprograms, in the application. The Copy module calls the other two. The copy\\nprogram fetches characters from the Read Keyboard module and routes them to the Write Printer module. \\nYou look at your design and see that it is good. You smile and then leave your ofﬁce to go to that review. At\\nleast you’ll be able to get a little sleep there.\\nOn Tuesday, you come in a bit early so that you can ﬁnish up the Copy program. Unfortunately, one of the\\ncrises in the ﬁeld has warmed up over night, and you have to go to the lab and help debug a problem. On your\\nlunch break, which you ﬁnally take at 3 p.m., you manage to type in the code for the Copy program.

So you wolf down your\\nTwinkies and coke and head off to the meeting.\\nOn Wednesday, you come in early again, and this time nothing seems to be amiss. So you pull up the source\\ncode for the Copy program and begin to compile it. Lo and behold, it compiles ﬁrst time with no errors! It’s a good\\nthing, too, because your boss calls you into an unscheduled meeting about the need to conserve laser printer toner.\\nOn Thursday, after spending four hours on the phone with a service technician in Rocky Mount, North\\nCarolina, walking him through the remote debugging and error logging commands in one of the more obscure\\ncomponents of the system, you grab a Ho Ho and then test your Copy program. It works, ﬁrst time! Good thing,\\ntoo, because your new co-op student has just erased the master source code directory from the server, and you have\\nto go ﬁnd the latest backup tapes and restore it.

You wonder why people are always changing the requirements. Your program wasn’t designed for a\\npaper tape reader! You warn your boss that changes like these are going to destroy the elegance of your design.\\nNevertheless, your boss is adamant. He says the users really need to read characters from the paper tape reader\\nfrom time to time.\\nSo, you sigh and plan your modiﬁcations. You’d like to add a boolean argument to the Copy function. If true,\\nthen you’d read from the paper tape reader; if false, you’d read from the keyboard as before. Unfortunately, there\\nare so many other programs using the Copy program now, that you can’t change the interface. Changing the inter-\\nface would cause weeks and weeks of recompiling and retesting. The system test engineers alone would lynch you,\\nnot to mention the seven guys in the conﬁguration control group. And the process police would have a ﬁeld day\\nforcing all kinds of code reviews for every module that called Copy!\\nNo, changing the interface is out. But then, how can you let the Copy program know that it must read from\\nthe paper tape reader? You’ll use a global of course! You’ll also use the best and most useful feature of the C suite\\nof languages, the ?: operator!

Writing software would be a lot easier if it weren’t for\\ncustomers.\\nYou tell your boss that these incessant changes are having a profoundly negative effect upon the elegance of\\nyour design. You warn him that if changes continue at this horrid pace, the software will be impossible to maintain\\nbefore year end. Your boss nods knowingly, and then tells you to make the change anyway.\\nThis design change is similar to the one before it. All we need is another global and another ?: operator!\\nListing 7-3 shows the result of your endeavors.\\nListing 7-3\\nbool ptFlag = false;\\nbool punchFlag = false;\\n// remember to reset these flags\\nvoid Copy()\\n{\\n  int c;\\n  while ((c=(ptflag ? RdPt() : RdKbd())) != EOF)\\n    punchFlag ? WrtPunch(c) : WrtPrt(c);\\n}\\nYou are especially proud of the fact that you remembered to change the comment. Still, you worry that the\\nstructure of your program is beginning to topple. Any more changes to the input device will certainly force you to\\ncompletely restructure the while-loop conditional. Perhaps it’s time to dust off your resume...\\nExpect Changes. I’ll leave it to you to determine just how much of the above was satirical exaggeration.\\nThe point of the story was to show how the design of a program can rapidly degrade in the presence of change. The\\noriginal design of the Copy program was simple and elegant. Yet after only two changes, it has begun to show the\\nsigns of Rigidity, Fragility, Immobility, Complexity, Redundancy, and Opacity. This trend is certainly going to con-\\ntinue, and the program will become a mess.\\nWe might sit back and blame this on the changes. We might complain that the program was well designed for\\nthe original spec, and that the subsequent changes to the spec caused the design to degrade. However, this ignores\\none of the most prominent facts in software development: requirements always change!\\nRemember, the most volatile things in most software projects are the requirements. The requirements are\\ncontinuously in a state of ﬂux. This is a fact that we, as developers, must accept! We live in a world of changing\\n92\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

This has to do with one of the fundamental tenets of object-oriented design.\\nThe initial design of the Copy program is inﬂexible because of the direction of its dependencies. Look\\nagain at Figure 7-1. Notice that the Copy module depends directly on the KeyboardReader and the\\nPrinterWriter. The Copy module is a high-level module in this application. It sets the policy of the application.\\nIt knows how to copy characters. Unfortunately, it has also been made dependent on the low-level details of the\\nkeyboard and printer. Thus, when the low-level details change, the high-level policy is affected.\\nOnce the inﬂexibility was exposed, the agile developers knew that the dependency from the Copy module to\\nthe input device needed to be inverted3 so that Copy would no longer depend on the input device. They then\\nemployed the STRATEGY4 pattern to create the desired inversion.\\nSo, in short, the agile developers knew what to do because\\n1. They detected the problem by following agile practices;\\n2. They diagnosed the problem by applying design principles; and\\n3. They solved the problem by applying the appropriate design pattern.\\nThe interplay between these three aspects of software development is the act of design.\\nKeeping the Design As Good As It Can Be\\nAgile developers are dedicated to keeping the design as appropriate and clean as possible. This is not a haphazard\\nor tentative commitment. Agile developers do not “clean up” the design every few weeks. Rather, they keep the\\nsoftware as clean, simple, and expressive as they possibly can, every day, every hour, and even every minute. They\\nnever say, “We’ll go back and ﬁx that later.” They never let the rot begin.\\nThe attitude that agile developers have toward the design of the software is the same attitude that surgeons\\nhave toward sterile procedure. Sterile procedure is what makes surgery possible. Without it, the risk of infection\\nwould be far too high to tolerate. Agile developers feel the same way about their designs. The risk of letting even\\nthe tiniest bit of rot begin is too high to tolerate. \\nThe design must remain clean, and since the source code is the most important expression of the design, it\\nmust remain clean, too. Professionalism dictates that we, as software developers, cannot tolerate code rot.\\nConclusion\\nSo, what is agile design? Agile design is a process, not an event. It’s the continous application of principles, pat-\\nterns, and practices to improve the structure and readability of the software. It is the dedication to keeping the\\ndesign of the system as simple, clean, and expressive as possible at all times. \\nDuring the chapters that follow, we’ll be investigating the principles and patterns of software design. As you\\nread them, remember that an agile developer does not apply those principles and patterns to a big, up-front design.\\nRather, they are applied from iteration to iteration in an attempt to keep the code, and the design it embodies,\\nclean.\\nBibliography\\n1.

Because each responsibil-\\nity is an axis of change. When the requirements change, that change will be manifest through a change in responsi-\\nbility amongst the classes. If a class assumes more than one responsibility, then there will be more than one reason\\nfor it to change.\\nIf a class has more than one responsibility, then the responsibilities become coupled. Changes to one respon-\\nsibility may impair or inhibit the ability of the class to meet the others. This kind of coupling leads to fragile\\ndesigns that break in unexpected ways when changed.\\nFor example, consider the design in Figure 8-1. The Rectangle class has two methods shown. One draws\\nthe rectangle on the screen, the other computes the area of the rectangle. \\nTwo different applications use the Rectangle class. One application does computational geometry. It uses\\nRectangle to help it with the mathematics of geometric shapes. It never draws the rectangle on the screen. The\\nother application is graphical in nature. It may also do some computational geometry, but it deﬁnitely draws the\\nrectangle on the screen.\\nThis design violates the Single-Responsibility Principle (SRP). The Rectangle class has two responsibili-\\nties. The ﬁrst responsibility is to provide a mathematical model of the geometry of a rectangle. The second respon-\\nsibility is to render the rectangle on a graphical user interface.\\nThis violation of the SRP causes several nasty problems. First, we must include the GUI in the computational\\ngeometry application. If this were a C++ application, the GUI would have to be linked in, consuming link time,\\ncompile time, and memory footprint. In a Java application, the .class ﬁles for the GUI have to be deployed to the\\ntarget platform.\\nSecond, if a change to the GraphicalApplication causes the Rectangle to change for some reason, that\\nchange may force us to rebuild, retest, and redeploy the ComputationalGeometryApplication. If we forget to\\ndo this, that application may break in unpredictable ways.\\nA better design is to separate the two responsibilities into two completely different classes as shown in Fig-\\nure 8-2. This design moves the computational portions of Rectangle into the GeometricRectangle class. Now\\nchanges made to the way rectangles are rendered cannot affect the ComputationalGeometryApplication. \\nFigure 8-1 More than one responsibility\\nFigure 8-2 Separated Responsibilities\\nComputational\\nGeometry\\nApplication\\nGraphical\\nApplication\\nRectangle\\n+ draw()\\n+ area() : double\\nGUI\\nComputational\\nGeometry\\nApplication\\nGraphical\\nApplication\\nRectangle\\n+ draw()\\nGeometric\\nRectangle\\n+ area() : double\\nGUI\\n96\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

This is sometimes hard to see. We are\\naccustomed to thinking of responsibility in groups. For example, consider the Modem interface in Listing 8-1. Most\\nof us will agree that this interface looks perfectly reasonable. The four functions it declares are certainly functions\\nbelonging to a modem.\\nListing 8-1\\nModem.java -- SRP Violation\\ninterface Modem\\n{\\n  public void dial(String pno);\\n  public void hangup();\\n  public void send(char c);\\n  public char recv();\\n}\\nHowever, there are two responsibilities being shown here. The ﬁrst responsibility is connection manage-\\nment. The second is data communication. The dial and hangup functions manage the connection of the modem,\\nwhile the send and recv functions communicate data. \\nShould these two responsibilities be separated? That depends on how the application is changing. If the\\napplication changes in ways that affect the signature of the connection functions, then the design will smell of\\nRigidity because the classes that call send and recv will have to be recompiled and redeployed more often than we\\nlike. In that case the two responsibilities should be separated as shown in Figure 8-3. This keeps the client applica-\\ntions from coupling the two responsibilities. \\nIf, on the other hand, the application is not changing in ways that cause the the two responsibilities to change\\nat different times, then there is no need to separate them. Indeed, separating them would smell of Needless\\nComplexity.\\nThere is a corollary here. An axis of change is an axis of change only if the changes actually occur . It is not\\nwise to apply the SRP, or any other principle for that matter, if there is no symptom.\\nSeparating Coupled Responsibilities\\nNotice that in Figure 8-3 I kept both responsibilities coupled in the ModemImplementation class. This is not\\ndesirable, but it may be necessary. There are often reasons, having to do with the details of the hardware or OS,\\nthat force us to couple things that we’d rather not couple. However, by separating their interfaces we have decou-\\npled the concepts as far as the rest of the application is concerned.\\nFigure 8-3 Separated Modem Interface\\n+ send(:char)\\n+ recv() : char\\nData\\nChannel\\n«interface»\\n+ dial(pno : String)\\n+ hangup()\\n«interface»\\nConnection\\nModem\\nImplementation\\n97\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

If the OCP is applied well, then further changes of that kind are achieved by adding new code, not\\nby changing old code that already works.\\nThis may seem like motherhood and apple pie—the golden unachievable ideal—but in fact there are some\\nrelatively simple and effective strategies for approaching that ideal.\\nDescription\\nModules that conform to the Open–Closed Principle have two primary attributes. They are\\n1. “Open for extension.”\\nThis means that the behavior of the module can be extended. As the requirements of the application change, \\nwe are able to extend the module with new behaviors that satisfy those changes. In other words, we are able \\nto change what the module does.\\n2. “Closed for modiﬁcation.”\\nExtending the behavior of a module does not result in changes to the source or binary code of the module. \\nThe binary executable version of the module, whether in a linkable library, a DLL, or a Java .jar, remains \\nuntouched.\\nIt would seem that these two attributes are at odds with each other. The normal way to extend the behavior of\\na module is to make changes to the source code of that module. A module that cannot be changed is normally\\nthought to have a ﬁxed behavior. \\nHow is it possible that the behaviors of a module can be modiﬁed without changing its source code? How\\ncan we change what a module does, without changing the module?\\nAbstraction Is the Key\\nIn C++, Java, or any other OOPL, 3 it is possible to create abstractions that are ﬁxed and yet represent an\\nunbounded group of possible behaviors. The abstractions are abstract base classes, and the unbounded group of\\npossible behaviors is represented by all the possible derivative classes. \\nIt is possible for a module to manipulate an abstraction. Such a module can be closed for modiﬁcation since\\nit depends upon an abstraction that is ﬁxed. Yet the behavior of that module can be extended by creating new deriv-\\natives of the abstraction.\\nFigure 9–1 shows a simple design that does not conform to the OCP. Both the Client and Server classes\\nare concrete. The Client class uses the Server class. If we wish for a Client object to use a different server\\nobject, then the Client class must be changed to name the new server class. \\nFigure 9–2 shows the corresponding design that conforms to the OCP. In this case, the ClientInterface\\nclass is an abstract class with abstract member functions. The Client class uses this abstraction; however, objects\\nof the Client class will be using objects of the derivative Server class. If we want Client objects to use a dif-\\nferent server class, then a new derivative of the ClientInterface class can be created. The Client class can\\nremain unchanged.\\nThe Client has some work that it needs to get done, and it can describe that work in terms of the abstract\\ninterface presented by ClientInterface. Subtypes of ClientInterface can implement that interface in any\\n3. Object-oriented programming language.\\nFigure 9-1 Client is not open and closed\\nClient Server\\n100\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

Thus, the behavior speciﬁed in Client can be extended and modiﬁed by creating new sub-\\ntypes of ClientInterface.\\nYou may wonder why I named ClientInterface the way I did. Why didn’t I call it AbstractServer\\ninstead? The reason, as we will see later, is that abstract classes are more closely associated to their clients than to\\nthe classes that implement them. \\nFigure 9-3 shows an alternative structure. The Policy class has a set of concrete public functions that\\nimplements a policy of some kind. Similar to the functions of the Client in Figure 9-2. As before, those policy\\nfunctions describe some work that needs to be done in terms of some abstract interfaces. However, in this case, the\\nabstract interfaces are part of the Policy class itself. In C++ they would be pure virtual functions, and in Java they\\nwould be abstract methods. Those functions are implemented in the subtypes of Policy. Thus, the behaviors spec-\\niﬁed within Policy can be extended or modiﬁed by creating new derivatives of the Policy class. \\nThese two patterns are the most common ways of satisfying the OCP. They represent a clear separation of\\ngeneric functionality from the detailed implementation of that functionality.\\nThe Shape Application\\nThe following example has been shown in many books on OOD. It is the infamous “Shape” example. It is nor-\\nmally used to show how polymorphism works. However, this time we will use it to elucidate the OCP. \\nWe have an application that must be able to draw circles and squares on a standard GUI. The circles and\\nsquares must be drawn in a particular order. A list of the circles and squares will be created in the appropriate\\norder, and the program must walk the list in that order and draw each circle or square.\\nViolating the OCP\\nIn C, using procedural techniques that do not conform to the OCP, we might solve this problem as shown in List-\\ning 9-1. Here we see a set of data structures that has the same ﬁrst element, but is different beyond that.

In fact, I would have to modify the function for any new type of shape that I needed\\nto draw.\\nOf course this program is only a simple example. In real life, the switch statement in the DrawAllShapes\\nfunction would be repeated over and over again in various functions all through the application, each one doing\\nsomething a little different. There might be functions for dragging shapes, stretching shapes, moving shapes, delet-\\ning shapes, etc. Adding a new shape to such an application means hunting for every place that such switch state-\\nments (or if/else chains) exist and adding the new shape to each. \\nMoreover, it is very unlikely that all the switch statements and if/else chains would be as nicely struc-\\ntured as the one in DrawAllShapes. It is much more likely that the predicates of the if statements would be com-\\nbined with logical operators or that the case clauses of the switch statements would be combined so as to\\n“simplify” the local decision making. In some pathological situations, there may be functions that do precisely the\\nsame things to Squares that they do to Circles. Such functions would not even have the switch/case state-\\nments or if/else chains. Thus, the problem of ﬁnding and understanding all the places where the new shape\\nneeds to be added can be nontrivial.\\nAlso, consider the kind of changes that would have to be made. We’d have to add a new member to the\\nShapeType enum. Since all the different shapes depend on the declaration of this enum, we’d have to recompile\\nthem all.4 And we’d also have to recompile all the modules that depend on Shape.\\nSo, not only must we change the source code of all switch/case statements or i f/else chains, but we\\nalso must alter the binary ﬁles (via recompilation) of all the modules that use any of the Shape data structures.\\nChanging the binary ﬁles means that any DLLs, shared libraries, or other kinds of binary components must be\\nredeployed. The simple act of adding a new shape to the application causes a cascade of subsequent changes to\\nmany source modules and to even more binary modules and binary components. Clearly, the impact of adding a\\nnew shape is very large.\\nBad Design. Let’s run through this again. The solution in\\nListing 9-1 is Rigid because the addition of Triangle causes\\nShape, Square, Circle, and DrawAllShapes to be recompiled\\nand redeployed. It is Fragile because there will be many other\\nswitch/case or if/else statements that are both hard to ﬁnd\\nand hard to decipher. It is Immobile because anyone attempting to\\nreuse DrawAllShapes in another program is required to bring\\nalong Square and Circle, even if that new program does not need\\nthem. Thus, Listing 9-1 exhibits many of the smells of bad design.\\nConforming to the OCP\\nListing 9-2 shows the code for a solution to the square/circle problem that conforms to the OCP. In this case,\\nwe have written an abstract class named Shape. This abstract class has a single abstract method named Draw. Both\\nCircle and Square are derivatives of the Shape class. \\nListing 9-2\\nOOD solution to Square/Circle problem.\\nclass Shape\\n{\\n  public: \\n    virtual void Draw() const = 0;\\n};\\n4.

Yet adding a new shape to the appli-\\ncation is still quite simple since all that is required is to create the new derivative and implement all its functions.\\nThere is no need to hunt through all of the application looking for places that require changes. This solution is not\\nFragile.\\nNor is the solution Rigid. No existing source modules need to be modiﬁed, and with one exception, no exist-\\ning binary modules need to be rebuilt.

The\\nabstractions we chose in Listing 9-2 are more of a hindrance to this kind of change than a help. You may ﬁnd this\\nsurprising. After all, what could be more natural than a Shape base class with Square and Circle derivatives?\\nWhy isn’t that natural model the best one to use? Clearly the answer is that the model is not natural in a system\\nwhere ordering is more signiﬁcant than shape type.\\nThis leads us to a disturbing conclusion. In general, no matter how “closed” a module is, there will always be\\nsome kind of change against which it is not closed. There is no model that is natural to all contexts!\\nSince closure cannot be complete, it must be strategic. That is, the\\ndesigner must choose the kinds of changes against which to close his\\ndesign. He must guess at the most likely kinds of changes, and then con-\\nstruct abstractions to protect him from those changes. \\nThis takes a certain amount of prescience derived from experience.\\nThe experienced designer hopes he knows the users and the industry well\\nenough to judge the probability of different kinds of changes. He then\\ninvokes the OCP against the most probable changes.\\nThis is not easy. It amounts to making educated guesses about the likely kinds of changes that the applica-\\ntion will suffer over time. When the developers guess right, they win. When they guess wrong, they lose. And they\\nwill certainly guess wrong much of the time. \\nAlso, conforming to the OCP is expensive. It takes development time and effort to create the appropriate\\nabstractions. Those abstractions also increase the complexity of the software design. There is a limit to the amount\\nof abstraction that the developers can afford. Clearly, we want to limit the application of the OCP to changes that\\nare likely.\\nHow do we know which changes are likely? We do the appropriate research, we ask the appropriate ques-\\ntions, and we use our experience and common sense. And after all that, we wait until the changes happen!\\nPutting the “Hooks” In\\nHow do we protect ourselves from changes? In the previous century, we had a saying. We’d “put the hooks in” for\\nchanges that we thought might take place. We felt that this would make our software ﬂexible.\\nHowever, the hooks we put in were often incorrect. Worse, they smelled of Needless Complexity that had to\\nbe supported and maintained, even though they weren’t used. This is not a good thing. We don’t want to load the\\ndesign with lots of unnecessary abstraction. Rather, we often wait until we actually need the abstraction, and then\\nwe put it in. \\nFool Me Once... There is an old saying: “Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.”\\nThis is a powerful attitude in software design. To keep from loading our software with Needless Complexity, we\\nmay permit ourselves to be fooled once. This means we initially write our code expecting it not to change. When a\\nchange occurs, we implement the abstractions that protect us from future changes of that kind. In short, we take the\\nﬁrst bullet, and then we make sure we are protected from any more bullets coming from that gun.\\nStimulating Change. If we decide to take the ﬁrst bullet, then it is to our advantage to get the bullets ﬂy-\\ning early and frequently. We want to know what kinds of changes are likely before we are very far down the devel-\\nopment path. The longer we wait to ﬁnd out what kinds of changes are likely, the harder it will be to create the\\nappropriate abstractions. \\nTherefore, we need to stimulate the changes. We do this through several of the means we discussed in\\nChapter 2. \\n105\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

Now we want to\\nprotect ourselves from any future changes of that kind. \\nHow can we close the DrawAllShapes function against changes in the ordering of drawing? Remember\\nthat closure is based upon abstraction. Thus, in order to close DrawAllShapes against ordering, we need some\\nkind of “ordering abstraction.” This abstraction would provide an abstract interface through which any possible\\nordering policy could be expressed. \\nAn ordering policy implies that, given any two objects, it is possible to discover which ought to be drawn\\nﬁrst. We can deﬁne an abstract method of Shape named Precedes. This function takes another Shape as an argu-\\nment and returns a bool result. The result is true if the Shape object that receives the message should be drawn\\nbefore the Shape object passed as the argument.\\nIn C++, this function could be represented by an overloaded operator< function.

But we still\\ndo not have a decent ordering abstraction. As it stands, the individual Shape objects will have to override the\\nPrecedes method in order to specify ordering. How would this work?

There is no way to close them against new derivatives of Shape. Every time a new derivative of\\nShape is created, all the Precedes() functions will need to be changed.6\\nOf course this doesn’t matter if no new derivatives of Shape are ever created. On the other hand, if they are\\ncreated frequently, this design would cause a signiﬁcant amount of thrashing. Again, we’d take the ﬁrst bullet.\\nUsing a “Data-Driven” Approach to Achieve Closure\\nIf we must close the derivatives of Shape from knowledge of each other, we can use a table-driven approach.

Generally, these problem are not\\nforeseen until we see them in code. \\nOur ﬁrst clue that something has gone wrong might be the fact that a Square does not need both itsHeight\\nand itsWidth member variables. Yet it will inherit them from Rectangle. Clearly, this is wasteful. In many\\ncases, such waste is insigniﬁcant. But if we must create hundreds of thousands of Square objects (e.g., a CAD/\\nCAE program in which every pin of every component of a complex circuit is drawn as a square), this waste could\\nbe signiﬁcant. \\nLet’s assume, for the moment, that we are not very concerned with memory efﬁciency. There are other prob-\\nlems that ensue from deriving Square from Rectangle. Square will inherit the SetWidth and SetHeight\\nfunctions. These functions are inappropriate for a Square, since the width and height of a square are identical.\\nThis is a strong indication that there is a problem. However, there is a way to sidestep the problem. We could over-\\nride SetWidth and SetHeight as follows:\\nvoid Square::SetWidth(double w)\\n{\\n  Rectangle::SetWidth(w);\\n  Rectangle::SetHeight(w);\\n}\\nvoid Square::SetHeight(double h)\\n{\\n  Rectangle::SetHeight(h);\\n  Rectangle::SetWidth(h);\\n}\\nNow, when someone sets the width of a Square object, its height will change correspondingly.

The\\nSquare object will remain a mathematically proper square.\\nSquare s;\\ns.SetWidth(1); // Fortunately sets the height to 1 too.\\ns.SetHeight(2); // sets width and height to 2. Good thing.\\nBut consider the following function:\\nvoid f(Rectangle& r)\\n{\\n  r.SetWidth(32); // calls Rectangle::SetWidth\\n}\\nIf we pass a reference to a Square object into this function, the Square object will be corrupted because the\\nheight won’t be changed. This is a clear violation of LSP. The f function does not work for derivatives of its argu-\\nments. The reason for the failure is that SetWidth and SetHeight were not declared virtual in Rectangle;\\ntherefore, they are not polymorphic.\\nWe can ﬁx this easily. However, when the creation of a derived class causes us to make changes to the base\\nclass, it often implies that the design is faulty. Certainly it violates the OCP. We might counter this by saying that\\nforgetting to make SetWidth and SetHeight virtual was the real design ﬂaw, and we are just ﬁxing it now.\\nHowever, this is hard to justify since setting the height and width of a rectangle are exceedingly primitive opera-\\ntions.

There is a technique for making those reasonable assumptions explicit,\\nthereby enforcing the LSP. The technique is called design by contract (DBC) and is expounded by Bertrand\\nMeyer.6 \\nUsing DBC, the author of a class explicitly states the contract for that class. The contract informs the author\\nof any client code about the behaviors that can be relied on. The contract is speciﬁed by declaring preconditions\\nand postconditions for each method. The preconditions must be true in order for the method to execute. On com-\\npletion, the method guarantees that the postconditions are true.\\nWe can view the postcondition of Rectangle::SetWidth(double w) as follows:\\nassert((itsWidth == w) && (itsHeight == old.itsHeight));\\nIn this example, old is the value of the Rectangle before SetWidth is called. Now the rule for precondi-\\ntions and postconditions of derivatives, as stated by Meyer, is:\\nA routine redeclaration [in a derivative] may only replace the original precondition by one equal or\\nweaker, and the original postcondition by one equal or stronger.7\\nIn other words, when using an object through its base-class interface, the user knows only the preconditions\\nand postconditions of the base class. Thus, derived objects must not expect such users to obey preconditions that\\nare stronger than those required by the base class. That is, they must accept anything that the base class could\\naccept. Also, derived classes must conform to all the postconditions of the base. That is, their behaviors and out-\\nputs must not violate any of the constraints established for the base class. Users of the base class must not be con-\\nfused by the output of the derived class.\\nClearly, the postcondition of Square::SetWidth(double w)  is weaker 8 than the postcondition of\\nRectangle::SetWidth(double w) , since it does not enforce the constraint, (itsHeight == old.its\\nHeight). Thus, the SetWidth method of Square violates the contract of the base class.\\nCertain languages, like Eiffel, have direct support for preconditions and postconditions. You can declare\\nthem and have the runtime system verify them for you. Neither C++ nor Java has such a feature. In these lan-\\nguages, we must manually consider the preconditions and postcondition of each method and make sure that\\nMeyer’s rule is not violated. Moreover, it can be very helpful to document these preconditions and postconditions\\nin the comments for each method.\\nSpecifying Contracts in Unit Tests\\nContracts can also be speciﬁed by writing unit tests. By thoroughly testing the behavior of a class, the unit tests\\nmake the behavior of the class clear. Authors of client code will want to review the unit tests so that they know\\nwhat to reasonably assume about the classes they are using.\\nA Real Example\\nEnough of squares and rectangles!

The containers were\\nroughly related to the Bags and Sets of Smalltalk. There were two varieties of Set and two similar varieties of\\nBag. The ﬁrst variety was called “bounded” and was based on an array. The second was called “unbounded” and\\nwas based on a linked list.\\nThe constructor for BoundedSet speciﬁed the maximum number of elements the set could hold. The space\\nfor these elements was preallocated as an array within the BoundedSet. Thus, if the creation of the BoundedSet\\nsucceeded, we could be sure that it had enough memory. Since it was based on an array, it was very fast. There\\nwere no memory allocations performed during normal operation. And since the memory was preallocated, we\\ncould be sure that operating the BoundedSet would not exhaust the heap. On the other hand, it was wasteful of\\nmemory since it would seldom completely utilize all the space that it had preallocated.\\nUnboundedSet, on the other hand, had no declared limit on the number of elements it could hold. So long\\nas there was heap memory avaliable, the UnboundedSet would continue to accept elements. Therefore, it was\\nvery ﬂexible. It was also economical in that it only used the memory necessary to hold the elements that it cur-\\nrently contained. It was also slow because it had to allocate and deallocate memory as part of its normal operation.\\nFinally, there was a danger that its normal operation could exhaust the heap.\\nI was unhappy with the interfaces of these third-party classes. I did not want my application code to be\\ndependent on them because I felt that I would want to replace them with better classes later. Thus, I wrapped the\\nthird-party containers in my own abstract interface as shown in Figure 10-2.\\nI created an abstract class called Set that presented pure virtual Add, Delete, and IsMember functions, as\\nshown in Listing 10-4. This structure uniﬁed the unbounded and bounded varieties of the two third-party sets and\\nallowed them to be accessed through a common interface. Thus, some client could accept an argument of type\\nSet<T>& and would not care whether the actual Set it worked on was of the bounded or unbounded variety.\\n(See the PrintSet function in Listing 10-5.)\\nListing 10-4\\nAbstract Set Class\\ntemplate <class T> \\nclass Set\\n{\\n  public:\\n    virtual void Add(const T&) = 0;\\n    virtual void Delete(const T&) = 0;\\n    virtual bool IsMember(const T&) const = 0;\\n};\\nFigure 10-2 Container class adapter layer\\nThird Party\\nUnbounded Set\\nThird Party\\nBounded SetBounded Set\\nSet\\nUnbounded Set\\n118\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

It means that the program-\\nmer can decide which kind of Set is needed in each particular instance, and none of the client functions will be\\naffected by that decision. The programmer may choose an UnboundedSet when memory is tight and speed is not\\ncritical, or the programmer may choose an BoundedSet when memory is plentiful and speed is critical. The client\\nfunctions will manipulate these objects through the interface of the base class Set and will therefore not know or\\ncare which kind of Set they are using.\\nProblem\\nI wanted to add a PersistentSet to this hierarchy. A persistent set is a set that can be written out to a stream and\\nthen read back in later, possibly by a different application. Unfortunately, the only third-party container that I had\\naccess to, that also offered persistence, was not a template class. Instead, it accepted objects that were derived\\nfrom the abstract base class PersistentObject. I created the hierarchy shown in Figure 10-3. \\nNote that PersistentSet contains an instance of the third-party persistent set, to which it delegates all its\\nmethods. Thus, if you call Add on the PersistentSet, it simply delegates that to the appropriate method of the\\ncontained third-party persistent set.\\nOn the surface of it, this might look all right. However, there is an ugly implication. Elements that are added\\nto the third-party persistent set must be derived from PersistentObject. Since PersistentSet simply dele-\\ngates to the third-party persistent set, any element added to PersistentSet must therefore derive from\\nPersistentObject. Yet the interface of Set has no such constraint.\\nWhen a client is adding members to the base class Set, that client cannot be sure whether or not the Set\\nmight actually be a PersistentSet. Thus, the client has no way of knowing whether or not the elements it adds\\nought to be derived from PersistentObject.\\nConsider the code for PersistentSet::Add() in Listing 10-6.\\nFigure 10-3 Persistent Set Hierarchy\\nPersistentSet\\nSet\\n<<delegates>> Third Party\\nPersistent Set\\nPersistent\\n Object\\n119\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

Certainly. Functions that never before failed when passed a derivative of Set may now\\ncause runtime errors when passed a PersistentSet.

Which is to say that I did not solve it\\nin source code. Rather, I established a convention whereby PersistentSet and PersistentObject were not\\nknown to the application as a whole. They were only known to one particular module. This module was responsi-\\nble for reading and writing all the containers to and from the persistent store. When a container needed to be\\nwritten, its contents were copied into appropriate derivatives of PersistentObject and then added to\\nPersistentSets, which were then saved on a stream. When a container needed to be read from a stream, the\\nprocess was inverted. A PersistentSet was read from the stream, and then the PersistentObjects were\\nremoved from the PersistentSet and copied into regular (nonpersistent) objects, which were then added to a\\nregular Set.\\nThis solution may seem overly restrictive, but it was the only way I could think of to prevent PersistentSet\\nobjects from appearing at the interface of functions that would want to add nonpersistent objects to them. Moreover,\\nit broke the dependency of the rest of the application on the whole notion of persistence.\\nDid this solution work? Not really. The convention was violated in several parts of the application by devel-\\nopers who did not understand the necessity for it. That is the problem with conventions—they have to be continu-\\nally resold to each developer. If the developer has not learned the convention, or does not agree with it, then the\\nconvention will be violated. And one violation can compromise the whole structure.\\nAn LSP-Compliant Solution\\nHow would I solve this now? I would acknowledge that a PersistentSet does not have an IS-A relationship\\nwith Set, that it is not a proper derivative of Set. Thus, I would separate the hierarchies, but not completely. There\\nare features that Set and PersistentSet have in common. In fact, it is only the Add method that causes the dif-\\nﬁculty with LSP. Consequently, I would create a hierarchy in which both Set and PersistentSet were siblings\\nbeneath an abstract interface that allowed for membership testing, iteration, etc. (See Figure 10-4.) This would\\nallow PersistentSet objects to be iterated and tested for membership, etc. But it would not afford the ability to\\nadd objects that were not derived from PersistentObject to a PersistentSet.\\n120\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

Yet, when these modules depend on the lower level modules, changes to\\nthe lower level modules can have direct effects on the higher level modules and can force them to change\\nin turn.\\nThis predicament is absurd! It is the high-level, policy-setting modules that ought to be inﬂuencing the low-\\nlevel, detailed modules. The modules that contain the high-level business rules should take precedence over, and\\nbe independent of, the modules that contain the implementation details. High-level modules simply should not\\ndepend on low-level modules in any way.\\nMoreover, it is high-level, policy-setting modules that we want to be able to reuse. We are already quite good\\nat reusing low-level modules in the form of subroutine libraries. When high-level modules depend on low-level\\nmodules, it becomes very difﬁcult to reuse those high-level modules in different contexts. However, when the\\nhigh-level modules are independent of the low-level modules, then the high-level modules can be reused quite sim-\\nply. This principle is at the very heart of framework design.\\nLayering\\nAccording to Booch, “...all well-structured object-oriented architectures have clearly deﬁned layers, with each\\nlayer providing some coherent set of services though a well-deﬁned and controlled interface.” 1 A naive interpre-\\ntation of this statement might lead a designer to produce a structure similar to Figure 11-1. In this diagram, the\\nhigh-level Policy layer uses a lower-level Mechanism layer, which in turn uses a detailed-level Utility\\nlayer. While this may look appropriate, it has the insidious characteristic that the Policy layer is sensitive to\\nchanges all the way down in the Utility layer. Dependency is transitive . The Policy layer depends on some-\\nthing that depends on the Utility layer; thus, the Policy layer transitively depends on the Utility layer.\\nThis is very unfortunate.\\nFigure 11-2 shows a more appropriate model. Each of the upper-level layers declares an abstract interface\\nfor the services that it needs. The lower-level layers are then realized from these abstract interfaces. Each higher-\\nlevel class uses the next-lowest layer through the abstract interface. Thus, the upper layers do not depend on the\\nlower layers. Instead, the lower layers depend on abstract service interfaces declared in the upper layers. Not only\\nis the transitive dependency of PolicyLayer on UtilityLayer broken, but even the direct dependency of the\\nPolicyLayer on MechanismLayer is broken. \\nAn Inversion of Ownership\\nNotice that the inversion here is not just one of dependencies, it is also one of interface ownership. We often think\\nof utility libraries as owning their own interfaces. But when the DIP is applied, we ﬁnd that the clients tend to own\\nthe abstract interfaces and that their servers derive from them. \\n1.

In Java, for example, it is the con-\\ncrete class String. This class is not volatile. That is, it does not change very often. Therefore it does no harm to\\ndepend directly on it. \\nHowever, most concrete classes that we write as part of an application program are volatile. It is those con-\\ncrete classes that we do not want to depend directly on. Their volatility can be isolated by keeping them behind an\\nabstract interface.\\nThis is not a complete solution. There are times when the interface of a volatile class must change, and this\\nchange must be propagated to the abstract interface that represents the class. Such changes break through the iso-\\nlation of the abstract interface.\\nThis is the reason that the heuristic is a bit naive. If, on the other hand, we take the longer view that the client\\nclasses declare the service interfaces that they need, then the only time the interface will change is when the client\\nneeds the change. Changes to the classes that implement the abstract interface will not affect the client.\\nA Simple Example\\nDependency inversion can be applied wherever one class sends a message to another. For example, consider the\\ncase of the Button object and the Lamp object. \\nThe Button object senses the external environment. On receiving the Poll message, it determines whether\\nor not a user has “pressed” it. It doesn’t matter what the sensing mechanism is. It could be a button icon on a GUI,\\na physical button being pressed by a human ﬁnger, or even a motion detector in a home security system. The\\nButton object detects that a user has either activated or deactivated it. \\nThe Lamp object affects the external environment. On receiving a TurnOn message, it illuminates a light of\\nsome kind. On receiving a TurnOff message, it extinguishes that light. The physical mechanism is unimportant. It\\ncould be an LED on a computer console, a mercury vapor lamp in a parking lot, or even the laser in a laser printer. \\nHow can we design a system such that the Button object controls the Lamp object? Figure 11-3 shows a\\nnaive design. The Button object receives Poll messages, determines if the button has been pressed, and then\\nsimply sends the TurnOn or TurnOff message to the Lamp.\\nWhy is this naive? Consider the Java code that is implied by this model (Listing 11-1). Note that the Button\\nclass depends directly on the Lamp class. This dependency implies that Button will be affected by changes to\\nLamp. Moreover, it will not be possible to reuse Button to control a Motor object.

The high-level policy of the application has not been separated from the low-\\nlevel implementation. The abstractions have not been separated from the details. Without such a separation, the\\nhigh-level policy automatically depends on the low-level modules, and the abstractions automatically depend on\\nthe details. \\nFinding the Underlying Abstraction\\nWhat is the high-level policy? It is the abstraction that underlies the application, the truths that do not vary when\\nthe details are changed. It is the system inside the system—it is the metaphor. In the Button/Lamp example, the\\nunderlying abstraction is to detect an on/off gesture from a user and relay that gesture to a target object. What\\nmechanism is used to detect the user gesture? Irrelevant! What is the target object? Irrelevant! These are details\\nthat do not impact the abstraction. \\nThe design in Figure 11-3 can be improved by inverting the dependency on the Lamp object. In Figure 11-4,\\nwe see that the Button now holds an association to something called a ButtonServer. ButtonServer provides\\nabstract methods that Button can use to turn something on or off. Lamp implements the ButtonServer interface.\\nThus, Lamp is now doing the depending, rather than being depended on.\\nThe design in Figure 11-4 allows a Button to control any device that is willing to implement the\\nButtonServer interface. This gives us a great deal of ﬂexibility. It also means that Button objects will be able to\\ncontrol objects that have not yet been invented.\\nHowever, this solution also puts a constraint on any object that needs to be controlled by a Button. Such an\\nobject must implement the ButtonServer interface. This is unfortunate because these objects may also want to\\nbe controlled by a Switch object or some object other than a Button. \\nBy inverting the direction of the dependency and making the Lamp do the depending instead of being\\ndepended on, we have made Lamp depend on a different detail— Button. Or have we?\\nLamp certainly depends on ButtonServer, but ButtonServer does not depend on Button. Any kind of\\nobject that knows how to manipulate the ButtonServer interface will be able to control a Lamp. Thus, the depen-\\ndency is in name only. And we can ﬁx that by changing the name of ButtonServer to something a bit more\\ngeneric like SwitchableDevice. We can also ensure that Button and SwitchableDevice are kept in separate\\nlibraries, so that the use of SwitchableDevice does not imply the use of Button.\\nIn this case, nobody owns the interface. We have the interesting situation where the interface can be used by\\nlots of different clients and implemented by lots of different servers. Thus, the interface needs to stand alone with-\\nout belonging to either group. In C++, we would put it in a separate namespace and library. In Java we would put\\nit in a separate package.4\\nFigure 11-4 Dependency Inversion Applied to the Lamp\\n4.

They do not have to inherit from a common base.\\nAs a template, Regulate does not depend on any particular implementation of these functions. All that is\\nrequired is that the class substituted for HEATER have an Engage and a Disengage method and that the class sub-\\nstituted for THERMOMETER have a Read function. Thus, those classes must implement the interface deﬁned by the\\ntemplate.

The\\narguments of this function are the time of the time-out, and a pointer to a TimerClient object whose TimeOut\\nfunction will be called when the time-out expires.\\nHow can we get the TimerClient class to communicate with the TimedDoor class so that the code in the\\nTimedDoor can be notiﬁed of the time-out? There are several alternatives. Figure 12-1 shows a naive solution. We\\nforce Door, and therefore TimedDoor, to inherit from TimerClient. This ensures that TimerClient can regis-\\nter itself with the Timer and receive the TimeOut message.\\nAlthough this solution is common, it is not without problems. Chief among these is that the Door class now\\ndepends on TimerClient. Not all varieties of Door need timing. Indeed, the original Door abstraction had noth-\\ning whatever to do with timing. If timing-free derivatives of Door are created, those derivatives will have to pro-\\nvide degenerate implementations for the TimeOut method—a potential violation of the LSP. Moreover, the\\napplications that use those derivatives will have to import the deﬁnition of the TimerClient class, even though it\\nis not used. That smells of Needless Complexity and Needless Redundancy.\\nThis is an example of interface pollution, a syndrome that is common in statically typed languages like C++\\nand Java. The interface of Door has been polluted with a method that it does not require. It has been forced to\\nincorporate this method solely for the beneﬁt of one of its subclasses. If this practice is pursued, then every time a\\nderivative needs a new method, that method will be added to the base class. This will further pollute the interface\\nof the base class, making it “fat.”\\nMoreover, each time a new method is added to the base class, that method must be implemented (or allowed to\\ndefault) in derived classes. Indeed, an associated practice is to add these interfaces to the base class giving them\\ndegenerate implementations, speciﬁcally so that derived classes are not burdened with the need to implement them.\\nAs we learned previously, such a practice can violate the LSP, leading to maintenance and reusability problems.\\nFigure 12-1 Timer Client at Top of Hierarchy\\nTimer\\nDoor\\nTimed Door\\n0..*\\n«interface»\\nTimer Client\\n+ Timeout\\n136\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

Timer uses\\nTimerClient, and classes that manipulate doors use Door. Since the clients are separate, the interfaces should\\nremain separate, too. Why? Because clients exert forces on the interfaces they use. \\nThe Backwards Force Applied by Clients On Interfaces\\nWhen we think of forces that cause changes in software, we normally think about how changes to interfaces will\\naffect their users. For example, we would be concerned about the changes to all the users of TimerClient if the\\nTimerClient interface changed. However, there is a force that operates in the other direction. Sometimes it is the\\nuser that forces a change to the interface. \\nFor example, some users of Timer will register more than one time-out request. Consider the TimedDoor.\\nWhen it detects that the Door has been opened, it sends the Register message to the Timer, requesting a time-\\nout. However, before that time-out expires, the door closes, remains closed for a while, and then opens again. This\\ncauses us to register a new time-out request before the old one has expired. Finally, the ﬁrst time-out request\\nexpires and the TimeOut function of the TimedDoor is invoked. The Door alarms falsely.\\nWe can correct this situation by using the convention shown in Listing 12-3. We include a unique\\ntimeOutId code in each time-out registration, and we repeat that code in the TimeOut call to the TimerClient.\\nThis allows each derivative of TimerClient to know which time-out request is being responded to.\\nListing 12-3\\nTimer with ID\\nclass Timer\\n{\\n  public:\\n    void Register(int timeout, \\n                  int timeOutId, \\n                  TimerClient* client);\\n};\\nclass TimerClient\\n{\\n  public:\\n    virtual void TimeOut(int timeOutId) = 0;\\n};\\nClearly this change will affect all the users of TimerClient. We accept this since the lack of the\\ntimeOutId is an oversight that needs correction. However, the design in Figure 12-1 will also cause Door, and all\\nclients of Door to be affected by this ﬁx! This smells of Rigidity and Viscosity. Why should a bug in TimerClient\\nhave any affect on clients of Door derivatives that do not require timing? When a change in one part of the pro-\\ngram affects other completely unrelated parts of the program, the cost and repercussions of changes become\\nunpredictable, and the risk of fallout from the change increases dramatically.\\nISP: The Interface-Segregation Principle\\nClients should not be forced to depend on methods that they do not use.\\nWhen clients are forced to depend on methods that they don’t use, then those clients are subject to changes to those\\nmethods.

We would like to avoid such couplings where\\npossible, and so we want to separate the interfaces.\\nClass Interfaces v. Object Interfaces\\nConsider the TimedDoor again. Here is an object which has two separate interfaces used by two separate clients—\\nTimer and the users of Door. These two interfaces must be implemented in the same object, since the implemen-\\ntation of both interfaces manipulates the same data. So how can we conform to the ISP? How can we separate the\\ninterfaces when they must remain together?\\nThe answer to this lies in the fact that clients of an object do not need to access it through the interface of the\\nobject. Rather, they can access it through delegation or through a base class of the object. \\nSeparation through Delegation\\nOne solution is to create an object that derives from TimerClient and delegates to the TimedDoor. Figure 12-2\\nshows this solution. \\nWhen the TimedDoor wants to register a time-out request with the Timer, it creates a DoorTimerAdapter\\nand registers it with the Timer. When the Timer sends the TimeOut message to the DoorTimerAdapter, the\\nDoorTimerAdapter delegates the message back to the TimedDoor.\\nThis solution conforms to the ISP and prevents the coupling of Door clients to Timer. Even if the change to\\nTimer shown in Listing 12-3 were to be made, none of the users of Door would be affected. Moreover,\\nTimedDoor does not have to have the exact same interface as TimerClient. The DoorTimerAdapter can\\ntranslate the TimerClient interface into the TimedDoor interface. Thus, this is a very general purpose solution.\\n(See Listing 12-4.)\\nListing 12-4\\nTimedDoor.cpp\\nclass TimedDoor : public Door\\n{\\n  public:\\n    virtual void DoorTimeOut(int timeOutId);\\n};\\nclass DoorTimerAdapter : public TimerClient\\n{\\n  public:\\n    DoorTimerAdapter(TimedDoor& theDoor)\\nFigure 12-2 Door Timer Adapter\\nTimer\\n0..*\\n«interface»\\n«creates»\\nTimer Client\\n+ Timeout\\nDoor Timer\\nAdapter\\n+ Timeout() + DoorTimeOut\\nDoor\\nTimed Door\\n138\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

Note that each transaction must somehow know about its particular version of\\nthe UI. DepositTransaction must know about DepositUI, WithdrawTransaction must know about\\nWithdrawUI, etc. In Listing 12-6, I have addressed this issue by forcing each transaction to be constructed with a\\nreference to its particular UI.

Another way to\\naddress this issue is to create a set of global constants as shown in Listing 12-8. Global variables are not always a\\nsymptom of a poor design. In this case they provide the distinct advantage of easy access. Since they are refer-\\nences, it is impossible to change them in any way. Therefore they cannot be manipulated in a way that would sur-\\nprise other users. \\nListing 12-8\\nSeperate Global Pointers\\n// in some module that gets linked in\\n// to the rest of the app.\\nstatic UI Lui; // non-global object;\\nDepositUI&   GdepositUI   = Lui;\\nWithdrawalUI& GwithdrawalUI = Lui;\\nTransferUI&  GtransferUI  = Lui;\\n// In the depositTransaction.h module\\nclass WithdrawalTransaction : public Transaction\\n{\\n  public:\\n    virtual void Execute()\\n    {\\n      ...\\n      GwithdrawalUI.RequestWithdrawalAmount();\\n      ...\\n    }\\n};\\n143\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

This means that any module wishing to use any of the UI interfaces transi-\\ntively depends on all of them— exactly the situation that the ISP warns us to avoid.

In the future, it may be that the interface objects are separated for some reason. The fact\\nthat all interfaces are combined into a single object is information that g does not need to know. Thus, I prefer the\\npolyadic form for such functions.\\nGrouping Clients. Clients can often be grouped together by the service methods they call. Such group-\\nings allow segregated interfaces to be created for each group instead of each client. This greatly reduces the num-\\nber of interfaces that the service has to implement, and it also prevents the service from depending on each client\\ntype.\\nSometimes, the methods invoked by different groups of clients will overlap. If the overlap is small, then the\\ninterfaces for the groups should remain separate. The common functions should be declared in all the overlapping\\ninterfaces. The server class will inherit the common functions from each of those interfaces, but it will implement\\nthem only once.\\nChanging Interfaces. When object-oriented applications are maintained, the interfaces to existing\\nclasses and components often change. There are times when these changes have a huge impact and force the\\nrecompilation and redeployment of a very large part of the system. This impact can be mitigated by adding new\\ninterfaces to existing objects, rather than changing the existing interface. Clients of the old interface that wish to\\naccess methods of the new interface can query the object for that interface, as shown in Listing 12-10.\\nListing 12-10\\nvoid Client(Service* s)\\n{\\n  if (NewService* ns = dynamic_cast<NewService*>(s))\\n  {\\n    // use the new service interface\\n  }\\n}\\nAs with all principles, care must be taken not to overdo it. The spectre of a class with hundreds of different\\ninterfaces, some segregated by client and others segregated by version, would be frightening indeed.\\nConclusion\\nFat classes cause bizarre and harmful couplings between their clients. When one client forces a change on the fat\\nclass, all the other clients are affected. Thus, clients should only have to depend on methods that they actually call.\\nThis can be achieved by breaking the interface of the fat class into many client-speciﬁc interfaces. Each client-spe-\\nciﬁc interface declares only those functions that its particular client, or client group, invoke. The fat class can then\\ninherit all the client-speciﬁc interfaces and implement them. This breaks the dependence of the clients on methods\\nthat they don’t invoke, and it allows the clients to be independent of each other.\\nBibliography\\n1. Gamma, et al. Design Patterns.

The system must pay each employee. Employees must be paid the correct amount, on time, by the method\\nthat they specify. Also, various deductions must be taken from their pay.\\n•Some employees work by the hour. They are paid an hourly rate that is one of the ﬁelds in their employee \\nrecord. They submit daily time cards that record the date and the number of hours worked. If they work more \\nthan 8 hours per day, they are paid 1.5 times their normal rate for those extra hours. They are paid every \\nFriday.\\n•Some employees are paid a ﬂat salary. They are paid on the last working day of the month. Their monthly \\nsalary is one of the ﬁelds in their employee record.\\n•Some of the salaried employees are also paid a commission based on their sales. They submit sales receipts \\nthat record the date and the amount of the sale. Their commission rate is a ﬁeld in their employee record. \\nThey are paid every other Friday.\\n•Employees can select their method of payment. They may have their paychecks mailed to the postal address \\nof their choice; they may have their paychecks held for pickup by the Paymaster; or they can request that \\ntheir paychecks be directly deposited into the bank account of their choice.\\n•Some employees belong to the union. Their employee record has a ﬁeld for the weekly dues rate. Their dues \\nmust be deducted from their pay. Also, the union may assess service charges against individual union mem-\\nbers from time to time. These service charges are submitted by the union on a weekly basis and must be \\ndeducted from the appropriate employee’s next pay amount.\\n•The payroll application will run once each working day and pay the appropriate employees on that day. The \\nsystem will be told to what date the employees are to be paid, so it will calculate payments from the last time \\nthe employee was paid up to the speciﬁed date.\\nExercise\\nBefore you continue, you might ﬁnd it instructive to design the payroll system on your own, now. You might want\\nto sketch some initial UML diagrams. Better yet, you might want to implement the ﬁrst few use cases test-ﬁrst.\\nApply the principles and practices we’ve learned so far, and try to create a balanced and healthy design.\\nIf you are going to do this, then take a look at the use cases that follow. Otherwise skip them, they’ll be pre-\\nsented again in the Payroll chapter.\\nUse Case 1: Add New Employee\\nA new employee is added by the receipt of an AddEmp transaction.

Yet, at this boundary where two paradigms clash, interesting\\nthings start to occur.\\nSimple Commands\\nSeveral years ago, I consulted for a large ﬁrm that made photocopiers. I was helping one of their development\\nteams with the design and implementation of the embedded real-time software that drove the inner workings of a\\nnew copier. We stumbled on the idea of using the COMMAND pattern to control the hardware devices. We created a\\nhierarchy that looked something like Figure 13-2. \\nThe role of these classes should be obvious. When you call do() on a RelayOnCommand, it turns some relay\\non. When you call do() on a MotorOffCommand, it turns some motor off. The address of the motor or relay is\\npassed into the object as an argument to its constructor. \\nWith this structure in place, we could now pass Command objects around the system and do() them without\\nknowing precisely what kind of Command they represented. This led to some interesting simpliﬁcations.\\nThe system was event driven. Relays opened or closed, motors started or stopped, and clutches engaged or\\ndisengaged based on certain events that took place in the system. Many of those events were detected by sensors.\\nFor example, when an optical sensor determined that a sheet of paper had reached a certain point in the paper path,\\nwe’d need to engage a certain clutch. We were able to implement this by simply binding the appropriate\\nClutchOnCommand to the object that controlled that particular optical sensor. (See Figure 13-3.)\\nThis simple structure has an enormous advantage. The Sensor has no idea what it is doing. Whenever it\\ndetects an event, it simply calls do() on the Command that it is bound to. This means that the Sensors don’t have\\nto know about individual clutches or relays. They don’t have to know the mechanical structure of the paper path.\\nTheir function becomes remarkably simple. \\nThe complexity of determining which relays to close when certain sensors declare events has moved to an\\ninitialization function. At some point during the initialization of the system, each Sensor is bound to an appropri-\\nFigure 13-2 Some Simple Commands for the Copier software\\nFigure 13-3 A Command driven by a Sensor\\n+ do()\\n«interface»\\nCommand\\nRelayOff\\nCommand\\nMotorOff\\nCommand\\nClutchOff\\nCommand\\nRelayOn\\nCommand\\nMotorOn\\nCommand\\nClutchOn\\nCommand\\nSensor Command\\n152\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

This puts all the wiring1 in one place and gets it out of the main body of the system. Indeed, it would\\nbe possible to create a simple text ﬁle that described which Sensors were bound to which Commands. The initial-\\nization program could read this ﬁle and build the system appropriately. Thus, the wiring of the system could be\\ndetermined completely outside the program, and it could be adjusted without recompilation.\\nBy encapsulating the notion of a command, this pattern allowed us to decouple the logical interconnections\\nof the system from the devices that were being connected. This was a huge beneﬁt.\\nTransactions\\nAnother common use of the C OMMAND pattern, and one that we will ﬁnd useful in the Payroll problem, is in the\\ncreation and execution of transactions. Imagine, for example, that we are writing the software that maintains a\\ndatabase of employees. (See Figure 13-4.) There are a number of operations that users can apply to that database.\\nThey can add new employees, delete old employees, or change the attributes of existing employees.\\nWhen a user decides to add a new employee, that user must specify all the information needed to success-\\nfully create the employee record. Before acting on that information, the system needs to verify that the information\\nis syntactically and semantically correct. The C OMMAND pattern can help with this job. The command object acts\\nas a repository for the unvalidated data, implements the validation methods, and implements the methods that\\nﬁnally execute the transaction.\\nFor example, consider Figure 13-5. The AddEmployeeTransaction contains the same data ﬁelds that\\nEmployee contains. It also holds a pointer to a PayClassification object. These ﬁelds and object are created\\nfrom the data that the user speciﬁes when directing the system to add a new employee. \\nThe validate method looks over all the data and makes sure it makes sense. It checks it for syntactic and\\nsemantic correctness. It may even check to ensure that the data in the transaction are consistent with the existing\\nstate of the database. For example, it might ensure that no such employee already exists.\\n1.

In our simple example, a new\\nEmployee object would be created and loaded with the ﬁelds from the AddEmployeeTransaction object. The\\nPayClassification object would be moved or copied into the Employee.\\nPhysical and Temporal Decoupling\\nThe beneﬁt this gives us is in the dramatic decoupling between the code that procures the data from the user, the\\ncode that validates and operates on that data, and the business objects themselves. For example, one might expect\\nthe data for adding a new employee to be procured from a dialog box in some GUI. It would be a shame if the GUI\\ncode contained the validation and execution algorithms for the transaction. Such a coupling would prevent that val-\\nidation and execution code from being used with other interfaces. By separating the validation and execution code\\ninto the AddEmployeeTransaction class, we have physically decoupled that code from the procurement inter-\\nface. What’s more, we’ve separated the code that knows how to manipulate the logistics of the database from the\\nbusiness entities themselves. \\nTemporal Decoupling\\nWe have also decoupled the validation and execution code in a different way. Once the data have been procured,\\nthere is no reason why the validation and execution methods must be called immediately. The transaction objects\\ncan be held in a list and validated and executed much later.\\nSuppose we have a database that must remain unchanged during the day. Changes may only be applied dur-\\ning the hours between midnight and 1 A.M. It would be a shame to have to wait until midnight and then have to\\nrush to type in all the commands before 1 A.M. It would be much more convenient to type in all the commands,\\nhave them validated on the spot, and then executed later at midnight.

The system creates a DrawCircleCommand and then calls do() on that command. The\\nDrawCircleCommand object tracks the user’s mouse waiting for a click in the drawing window. On receiving that\\nclick, it sets the click point as the center of the circle and proceeds to draw an animated circle at that center with a\\nradius that tracks the current mouse position. When the user clicks again, the DrawCircleCommand stops animat-\\ning the circle and adds the appropriate circle object to the list of shapes currently displayed on the canvas. It also\\nstores the ID of the new circle in some private variable of its own. Then it returns from the do() method.

The implications of the relationship were profound. With inheritance we could program by difference!\\nThat is, given some class that did something almost useful to us, we could create a subclass and change only the\\nbits we didn’t like. We could reuse code simply by inheriting it! We could establish whole taxonomies of software\\nstructures, each level of which reused code from the levels above. It was a brave new world.\\nLike most brave new worlds, this one turned out to be a bit too starry eyed. By 1995, it was clear that inher-\\nitance was very easy to overuse and that overuse of inheritance was very costly. Gamma, Helm, Johnson, and\\nVlissides went so far as to stress, “Favor object composition over class inheritance.”1 So we cut back on our use of\\ninheritance, often replacing it with composition or delegation.\\nThis chapter is the story of two patterns that epitomize the difference between inheritance and delegation.\\nTEMPLATE METHOD and STRATEGY solve similar problems and can often be used interchangeably. However, TEM-\\nPLATE METHOD uses inheritance to solve the problem, whereas STRATEGY uses delegation.\\nTEMPLATE M ETHOD and S TRATEGY both solve the problem of separating a generic algorithm from a\\ndetailed context. We see the need for this very frequently in software design. We have an algorithm that is generi-\\ncally applicable.

Here we see all the elements of the standard program. The\\nInputStreamReader and BufferedReader are initialized. There is a main loop that reads Fahrenheit readings\\nfrom the BufferedReader and prints out Celsius conversions. At the end, an exit message is printed.\\nListing 14-1\\nftoc raw\\nimport java.io.*;\\npublic class ftocraw\\n{\\n  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception\\n  {\\n    InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);\\n    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);\\n    boolean done = false;\\n    while (!done)\\n    {\\n      String fahrString = br.readLine();\\n      if (fahrString == null || fahrString.length() == 0)\\n        done = true;\\n      else\\n      {\\n        double fahr = Double.parseDouble(fahrString);\\n        double celcius = 5.0/9.0*(fahr-32);\\n        System.out.println(\"F=\" + fahr + \", C=\" + celcius);\\n      }\\n    }\\n    System.out.println(\"ftoc exit\");\\n  }\\n}\\nThis program has all the elements of the main-loop structure. It does a little initialization, does its work in a\\nmain loop, and then cleans up and exits.\\n2. I’ve also got this bridge I’d like to sell you.\\n162\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

Both impose some kind of policy on another\\ngroup of objects. F ACADE imposes policy from above, and M EDIATOR imposes policy from below. The use of\\nFACADE is visible and constraining, while the use of MEDIATOR is invisible and enabling.\\nFACADE\\nThe FACADE pattern is used when you want to provide a simple and speciﬁc interface onto a group of objects that\\nhas a complex and general interface. Consider, for example, DB.java in Listing 26-9 on page 333. This class\\nimposes a very simple interface, speciﬁc to ProductData, on the complex and general interfaces of the classes\\nwithin the java.sql package. Figure 15-1 shows the structure.\\nNotice that the DB class protects the Application from needing to know the intimacies of the java.sql\\npackage. It hides all the generality and complexity of java.sql behind a very simple and speciﬁc interface. \\nA FACADE like DB imposes a lot of policy on the usage of the java.sql package. It knows how to initialize\\nand close the database connection. It knows how to translate the members of ProductData into database ﬁelds\\nand back. It knows how to build the appropriate queries and commands to manipulate the database. And it hides all\\nthat complexity from its users. From the point of view of the Application, java.sql does not exist; it is hidden\\nbehind the FACADE. \\nFrom Chapter 15 of Agile Software Development, Principles, Patterns, and Practices, First Edition.

However, whereas Facade imposed its policy in a visible and\\nconstraining way, M EDIATOR imposes its policies in a hidden and unconstrained way.

It is; and there is none else beside It. ”\\n—The point. Flatland. Edwin A. Abbott\\nUsually there is a one-to-many relationship between classes and instances. You can create many instances of most\\nclasses. The instances are created when they are needed and disposed of when their usefulness ends. They come\\nand go in a ﬂow of memory allocations and deallocations. \\nHowever, there are some classes that should have only one instance. That instance should appear to have\\ncome into existence when the program started and should be disposed of only when the program ends. Such\\nobjects are sometimes the roots of the application. From the roots you can ﬁnd your way to many other objects in\\nthe system. Sometimes they are factories, which you can use to create the other objects in the system. Sometimes\\nthese objects are managers, responsible for keeping track of certain other objects and driving them through their\\npaces.\\nWhatever these objects are, it is a severe logic failure if more than one of them are created. If more than one\\nroot are created, then access to objects in the application may depend on a chosen root. Programmers, not knowing\\nthat more than one root exist, may ﬁnd themselves looking at a subset of the application objects without knowing\\nit. If more than one factory exist, clerical control over the created objects may be compromised. If more than one\\nmanager exist, activities that were intended to be serial may become concurrent.\\nFrom Chapter 16 of Agile Software Development, Principles, Patterns, and Practices, First Edition.

After all, when you ini-\\ntialize the application, you can simply create one of each and be done with it. In fact, this is usually the best course\\nof action. Mechanism should be avoided when there is no immediate and signiﬁcant need. However, we also want\\nour code to communicate our intent. If the mechanism for enforcing singularity is trivial, the beneﬁt of communi-\\ncation may outweigh the cost of the mechanism.\\nThis chapter is about two patterns that enforce singularity. These patterns have very different cost–beneﬁt\\ntrade-offs. In many contexts, their cost is low enough to more than balance the beneﬁt of their expressiveness. \\nSINGLETON1\\nSINGLETON is a very simple pattern. The test case in Listing 16-1 shows how it should work. The ﬁrst test function\\nshows that the Singleton instance is accessed through the public static method Instance. It also shows that if\\nInstance is called multiple times, a reference to the exact same instance is returned each time. The second test\\ncase shows that the Singleton class has no public constructors, so there is no way for anyone to create an\\ninstance without using the Instance method.\\nListing 16-1\\nSingleton Test Case\\nimport junit.framework.*;\\nimport java.lang.reflect.Constructor;\\npublic class TestSimpleSingleton extends TestCase\\n{\\n  public TestSimpleSingleton(String name)\\n  {\\n    super(name);\\n  }\\n  public void testCreateSingleton()\\n  {\\n    Singleton s = Singleton.Instance();\\n    Singleton s2 = Singleton.Instance();\\n    assertSame(s, s2);\\n  }\\n  public void testNoPublicConstructors() throws Exception\\n  {\\n    Class singleton = Class.forName(\"Singleton\");\\n    Constructor[] constructors = singleton.getConstructors();\\n    assertEquals(\"public constructors.\", \\n                 0, constructors.length);\\n  }\\n}\\nThis test case is a speciﬁcation for the SINGLETON pattern. It leads directly to the code shown in Listing 16-2. It\\nshould be clear, by inspecting this code, that there can never be more than one instance of the Singleton class\\nwithin the scope of the static variable Singleton.theInstance.\\n1.

Using appropriate middleware (e.g., RMI), SINGLETON can be extended to work across \\nmany JVMs and many computers.\\n• Applicable to any class. You can change any class into a SINGLETON simply by making its constructors pri-\\nvate and by adding the appropriate static functions and variable.\\n• Can be created through derivation. Given a class, you can create a subclass that is a SINGLETON.\\n• Lazy evaluation. If the SINGLETON is never used, it is never created.\\nCosts of the SINGLETON\\n• Destruction is undeﬁned. There is no good way to destroy or decommission a SINGLETON. If you add a \\ndecommission method that nulls out theInstance, other modules in the system may still be holding a \\nreference to the SINGLETON instance. Subsequent calls to Instance will cause another instance to be cre-\\nated, causing two concurrent instances to exist. This problem is particularly acute in C++ where the instance \\ncan be destroyed, leading to possible dereferencing of a destroyed object.\\n• Not inherited. A class derived from a SINGLETON is not a singleton. If it needs to be a SINGLETON, the static \\nfunction and variable need to be added to it.\\n• Efﬁciency. Each call to Instance invokes the if statement. For most of those calls, the if statement is \\nuseless.\\n• Nontransparent. Users of a SINGLETON know that they are using a SINGLETON because they must invoke \\nthe Instance method.\\nSINGLETON in Action\\nAssume that we have a Web-based system that allows users to log in to secure areas of a Web server. Such a system\\nwill have a database containing user names, passwords, and other user attributes. Assume further that the database\\nis accessed through a third-party API. We could access the database directly in every module that needed to read\\nand write a user. However, this would scatter usage of the third-party API throughout the code, and it would leave\\nus no place to enforce access or structure conventions.\\nA better solution is to use the F ACADE pattern and create a UserDatabase class that provides methods for\\nreading and writing User objects. These methods access the third-party API of the database, translating between\\nUser objects and the tables and rows of the database. Within the UserDatabase, we can enforce conventions of\\nstructure and access. For example, we can guarantee that no User record gets written unless it has a nonblank\\nusername. Or we can serialize access to a User record, making sure that two modules cannot simultaneously read\\nand write it.\\n179\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

No matter how many instances of Monostate you create, they\\nall behave as though they were a single object. You can even destroy or decommission all the current instances\\nwithout losing the data.\\nNote that the difference between the two patterns is one of behavior vs. structure. The S INGLETON pattern\\nenforces the structure of singularity. It prevents any more than one instance from being created. Whereas\\nMONOSTATE enforces the behavior of singularity without imposing structural constraints. To underscore this dif-\\nference consider that the M ONOSTATE test case is valid for the Singleton class, but the S INGLETON test case is\\nnot even close to being valid for the Monostate class.\\nBeneﬁts of MONOSTATE\\n• Transparency. Users of a MONOSTATE do not behave differently than users of a regular object. The users do \\nnot need to know that the object is MONOSTATE.\\n• Derivability. Derivatives of a MONOSTATE are MONOSTATES. Indeed, all the derivatives of a MONOSTATE \\nare part of the same MONOSTATE. They all share the same static variables.\\n• Polymorphism. Since the methods of a MONOSTATE are not static, they can be overridden in a derivative. \\nThus different derivatives can offer different behavior over the same set of static variables.\\n• Well-deﬁned creation and destruction. The variables of a MONOSTATE, being static, have well-deﬁned \\ncreation and destruction times.\\nCosts of MONOSTATE\\n• No conversion. A normal class cannot be converted into a MONOSTATE class through derivation.\\n• Efﬁciency. A MONOSTATE may go through many creations and destructions because it is a real object. These \\noperations are often costly.\\n• Presence. The variables of a MONOSTATE take up space, even if the MONOSTATE is never used.\\n• Platform local. You can’t make a MONOSTATE work across several JVM instances or across several \\nplatforms.\\nMONOSTATE in Action\\nConsider implementing the simple ﬁnite state machine for a subway turnstile shown in Figure 16-1. The turnstile\\nbegins its life in the Locked state. If a coin is deposited, it transitions to the Unlocked state, unlocks the gate,\\nresets any alarm state that might be present, and deposits the coin in its collection bin. If a user passes through the\\ngate at this point, the turnstile transitions back to the Locked state and locks the gate.\\nThere are two abnormal conditions. If the user deposits two or more coins before passing through the gate,\\nthe coins will be refunded and the gate will remain unlocked. If the user passes through without paying, then an\\nalarm will sound and the gate will remain locked.\\nThe test program that describes this operation is shown in Listing 16-7. Note that the test methods assume\\nthat the Turnstile is a monostate.

However, try/catch blocks can be even uglier than checking for null. Worse, the use of excep-\\ntions forces us to declare them in throws clauses. This makes it hard to retroﬁt exceptions into an existing\\napplication.\\nWe can address these issues by using the N ULL OBJECT pattern.1 This pattern often eliminates the need to\\ncheck for null, and it can help to simplify the code. \\nFigure 17-1 shows the structure. Employee becomes an interface that has two implementations. Employee-\\nImplementation is the normal implementation. It contains all the methods and variables that you would expect\\nan Employee object to have. When DB.getEmployee ﬁnds an employee in the database, it returns an instance of\\nEmployeeImplementation. NullEmployee is returned only if DB.getEmployee cannot ﬁnd the employee. \\nNullEmployee implements all the methods of Employee to do “nothing.” What “nothing” is depends on\\nthe method. For example, one would expect that isTimeToPay would be implemented to return false, since it is\\nnever time to pay a NullEmployee. \\nUsing this pattern, we can change the original code to look like this:\\nEmployee e = DB.getEmployee(\"Bob\");\\nif (e.isTimeToPay(today))\\n  e.pay();\\nThis is neither error prone nor ugly. There is a nice consistency to it. DB.getEmployee always returns an\\ninstance of Employee. That instance is guaranteed to behave appropriately, regardless of whether the employee\\nwas found or not. \\nOf course there will be many cases where we’ll still want to know if DB.getEmployee failed to ﬁnd an\\nemployee. This can be accomplished by creating a static final variable in Employee that holds the one and\\nonly instance of NullEmployee. \\nListing 17-1 shows the test case for NullEmployee.

You will\\nﬁnd the user stories in this case study to be simplistic. For example, taxes are simply not mentioned. This is typical\\nof an early iteration. It will provide only a very small part of the business value the customers need.\\nIn this chapter we will do the kind of quick analysis and design session that often takes place at the start of a\\nnormal iteration. The customer has selected the stories for the iteration, and now we have to ﬁgure out how we are\\ngoing to implement them. Such design sessions are short and cursory, just like this chapter. The UML diagrams\\nyou see here are no more than hasty sketches on a whiteboard. The real design work will take place in the next\\nchapter, when we work through the unit tests and implementations.\\nSpeciﬁcation\\nThe following are some notes we took while conversing with our customer about the stories that were selected for\\nthe ﬁrst iteration:\\nFrom Chapter 18 of Agile Software Development, Principles, Patterns, and Practices, First Edition.

They are paid an hourly rate that is one of the ﬁelds in their employee \\nrecord. They submit daily time cards that record the date and the number of hours worked. If they work more \\nthan 8 hours per day, they are paid 1.5 times their normal rate for those extra hours. They are paid every Friday.\\n•Some employees are paid a ﬂat salary. They are paid on the last working day of the month. Their monthly \\nsalary is one of the ﬁelds in their employee record.\\n•Some of the salaried employees are also paid a commission based on their sales. They submit sales receipts \\nthat record the date and the amount of the sale. Their commission rate is a ﬁeld in their employee record. \\nThey are paid every other Friday.\\n•Employees can select their method of payment. They may have their paychecks mailed to the postal address \\nof their choice; they may have their paychecks held for pickup by the paymaster; or they can request that \\ntheir paychecks be directly deposited into the bank account of their choice.\\n•Some employees belong to the union. Their employee record has a ﬁeld for the weekly dues rate. Their dues \\nmust be deducted from their pay. Also, the union may assess service charges against individual union mem-\\nbers from time to time. These service charges are submitted by the union on a weekly basis and must be \\ndeducted from the appropriate employee’s next pay amount.\\n•The payroll application will run once each working day and pay the appropriate employees on that day. The \\nsystem will be told to what date the employees are to be paid, so it will generate payments for records from \\nthe last time the employee was paid up to the speciﬁed date.\\nWe could begin by generating the database schema. Clearly this problem could use some kind of relational\\ndatabase, and the requirements give us a very good idea of what the tables and ﬁelds might be. It would be easy to\\ndesign a workable schema and then start building some queries. However, this approach will generate an applica-\\ntion for which the database is the central concern. \\nDatabases are implementation details! Considering the database should be deferred as long as possible. Far\\ntoo many applications are inextricably tied to their databases because they were designed with the database in\\nmind from the beginning. Remember the deﬁnition of abstraction: the ampliﬁcation of the essential and the elimi-\\nnation of the irrelevant. The database is irrelevant at this stage of the project; it is merely a technique used for stor-\\ning and accessing data, nothing more.\\nAnalysis by Use Cases\\nInstead of starting with the data of the system, let’s start by considering the behavior of the system. After all, it is\\nthe system’s behavior that we are being paid to create. \\nOne way to capture and analyze the behavior of a system is to create use cases. Use cases, as originally\\ndescribed by Jacobson, are very similar to the notion of user stories in XP. A use case is like a user story that has\\nbeen elaborated with a little more detail. Such elaboration is appropriate once the user story has been selected for\\nimplementation in the current iteration.\\nWhen we perform use case analysis, we look to the user stories and acceptance tests to ﬁnd out the kinds of\\nstimuli that the users of this system provide. Then we try to ﬁgure out how the system responds to those stimuli. \\nFor example, here are the user stories that our customer has chosen for the next iteration:\\n1. Add a new employee\\n2. Delete an employee\\n3. Post a time card\\n4. Post a sales receipt\\n5. Post a union service charge\\n6. Change employee details (e.g., hourly rate, dues rate.)\\n7.

(See Figure 18-1.)\\nThis structure conforms nicely to the Single-Responsibility Principle (SRP) by splitting each job into its own\\nclass. The alternative would be to put all these jobs into a single module. While this might reduce the number of\\nclasses in the system, and therefore make the system simpler, it would also concentrate all the transaction process-\\ning code in one place, creating a large and potentially error-prone module.\\nUse case 1 speciﬁcally talks about an employee record, which implies some sort of database. Again our pre-\\ndisposition to databases may tempt us into thinking about record layouts or the ﬁeld structure in a relational data-\\nbase table, but we should resist these urges. What the use case is really asking us to do is to create an employee.\\nWhat is the object model of an employee? A better question might be, What do the three different transactions cre-\\nate? In my view, they create three different kinds of employee objects, mimicking the three different kinds of\\nAddEmp transactions. Figure 18-2 shows a possible structure. \\nUse Case 1 \\nAdd New Employee\\nA new employee is added by the receipt of an AddEmp transaction. This transaction contains the employee’s\\nname, address, and assigned employee number.   The transaction has three forms:\\nAddEmp <EmpID> \"<name>\" \"<address>\" H <hourly-rate>\\nAddEmp <EmpID> \"<name>\" \"<address>\" S <monthly-salary>\\nAddEmp <EmpID> \"<name>\" \"<address>\" C <monthly-salary> <commission-rate>\\nThe employee record is created with its ﬁelds assigned appropriately.\\nAlternative 1:\\nAn error in the transaction structure\\nIf the transaction structure is inappropriate, it is printed out in an error message, and no action is taken.\\nFigure 18-1 AddEmployeeTransaction Class Hierarchy\\nAddEmployee\\nTransaction\\nAddHourly\\nEmployee\\nTransaction\\nAddSalaried\\nEmployee\\nTransaction\\nAddCommissioned\\nEmployee\\nTransaction\\n- Name\\n- EmployeeId\\n- Address\\n195\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

There are many different ways to provide this kind of association, so to avoid being arbi-\\ntrary, let’s defer this decision until later. Perhaps constraints from other parts of the system will force our hand one\\nway or another.\\nOne thing is certain. There is a direct association between union members and their service charges. Figure 18-5\\nshows a possible static model for this association.\\nChanging Employee Details\\nThis use case is very revealing. It has told us all the aspects of an employee that must be changeable. The fact\\nthat we can change an employee from hourly to salaried means that the diagram in Figure 18-2 is certainly invalid.\\nInstead, it would probably be more appropriate to use the STRATEGY pattern for calculating pay. The Employee class\\ncould hold a strategy class named PaymentClassification, as in Figure 18-6. This is an advantage because we\\ncan change the PaymentClassification object without changing any other part of the Employee object. When\\nan hourly employee is changed to a salaried employee, the HourlyClassification of the corresponding\\nEmployee object is replaced with a SalariedClassification object. \\nPaymentClassification objects come in three varieties. The HourlyClassification objects main-\\ntain the hourly rate and a list of TimeCard objects. The SalariedClassification objects maintain the\\nmonthly salary ﬁgure. The CommissionedClassification objects maintain a monthly salary, a commission\\nrate, and a list of SalesReceipt objects. I have used composition relationships in these cases because I believe\\nthat TimeCards and SalesReceipts should be destroyed when the employee is destroyed. \\nThe method of payment must also be changeable. Figure 18-6 implements this idea by using the S TRATEGY\\npattern and deriving three different kinds of PaymentMethod classes. If an Employee object contains a\\nFigure 18-5 Union Members and Service Charges\\nUse Case 6  \\nChanging Employee Details\\nUpon receiving this transaction, the system will alter one of the details of the appropriate employee record.\\nThere are several possible variations to this transaction.\\nChgEmp <EmpID> Name <name>  Change Employee Name\\nChgEmp <EmpID> Address <address>  Change Employee Address\\nChgEmp <EmpID> Hourly <hourlyRate> Change to Hourly \\nChgEmp <EmpID> Salaried <salary> Change to Salaried\\nChgEmp <EmpID> Commissioned <salary> <rate> Change to Commissioned\\nChgEmp <EmpID> Hold Hold Paycheck\\nChgEmp <EmpID> Direct <bank> <account> Direct Deposit\\nChgEmp <EmpID> Mail <address> Mail Paycheck\\nChgEmp <EmpID> Member <memberID> Dues <rate> Put Employee in Union\\nChgEmp <EmpID> NoMember Remove Employee from Union\\nAlternative 1:\\nTransaction Errors\\nIf the structure of the transaction is improper, or <EmpID> does not refer to a real employee, or <memberID>\\nalready refers to a member, then print a suitable error and take no further action.\\n0..*\\nUnionMember ServiceCharge\\n198\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

If the employee is commissioned, the system\\nmust tally up his sales receipts, multiply by the commission rate, and add the base salary. But where does this get\\ndone?

Figures 18-6 through 18-10 came about by thinking about the use cases, that is, thinking about behavior. \\nFinding the Underlying Abstractions\\nTo use the OCP effectively, we must hunt for abstractions and ﬁnd\\nthose that underlie the application. Often these abstractions are not\\nstated or even alluded to by the requirements of the application, or\\neven the use cases. Requirements and use cases may be too steeped in\\ndetails to express the generalities of the underlying abstractions.\\nWhat are the underlying abstractions of the Payroll applica-\\ntion? Let’s look again at the requirements. We see statements such as\\n“Some employees work by the hour,” “Some employees are paid a\\nﬂat salary,” and “Some [...] employees are paid a commission.” This hints at the following generalization: “All\\nemployees are paid, but they are paid by different schemes.” The abstraction here is that “All employees are\\npaid.” Our model of the PaymentClassification in Figures 18-7 through 18-10 expresses this abstraction\\nnicely. Thus, this abstraction has already been found among our user stories by doing a very simple use-case\\nanalysis.\\nThe Schedule Abstraction\\nLooking for other abstractions, we ﬁnd “They are paid every Friday,” “They are paid on the last working day of the\\nmonth,” and “They are paid every other Friday.” This leads us to another generality: “All employees are paid\\naccording to some schedule.” The abstraction here is the notion of the schedule. It should be possible to ask an\\nEmployee object whether a certain date is its payday. The use cases barely mention this. The requirements associ-\\nate an employee’s schedule with his payment classiﬁcation. Speciﬁcally, hourly employees are paid weekly, sala-\\nried employees are paid monthly, and employees receiving commissions are paid biweekly; however, is this\\nassociation essential? Might not the policy change one day so that employees could select a particular schedule or\\nso that employees belonging to different departments or different divisions could have different schedules? Might\\nnot the schedule policy change independently of the payment policy? Certainly, this seems likely.\\nIf, as the requirements imply, we delegated the issue of schedule to the PaymentClassification class,\\nthen our class could not be closed against issues of change in schedule. When we changed payment policy, we\\nwould also have to test schedule. When we changed schedules, we would also have to test payment policy. Both\\nthe OCP and the SRP would be violated.\\nAn association between schedule and payment policy could lead to bugs in which a change to a particular\\npayment policy caused incorrect scheduling of certain employees. Bugs like this may make sense to programmers,\\nbut they strike fear in the hearts of managers and users. They fear, and rightly so, that if schedules can be broken\\nby a change to payment policy, then any change made anywhere might cause problems in any other unrelated part\\nof the system. They fear that they cannot predict the effects of a change. When effects cannot be predicted,\\nconﬁdence is lost and the program assumes the status of “dangerous and unstable” in the minds of its managers\\nand users.\\nFigure 18-10 Calculating a Salaried Employee’s Pay\\nSalaried\\nClassification\\n1:CalculatePay\\nDate Pay\\n201\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

Overreliance on tools and procedures, and underreliance on intelligence and experience are\\nrecipes for disaster.\\nFigures 18-11 and 18-12 show the static and dynamic models for the schedule abstraction. As you can see,\\nwe’ve employed the STRATEGY pattern yet again. The Employee class contains the abstract PaymentSchedule\\nclass. There are three varieties of PaymentSchedule that correspond to the three known schedules by which\\nemployees are paid. \\nPayment Methods\\nAnother generalization that we can make from the requirements is “All employees receive their pay by some\\nmethod.” The abstraction is the PaymentMethod class. Interestingly enough, this abstraction is already expressed\\nin Figure 18-6.\\nAfﬁliations\\nThe requirements imply that employees may have afﬁliations with a union; however, the union may not be the only\\norganization that has a claim to some of an employee’s pay. Employees might want to make automatic contribu-\\ntions to certain charities or have their dues to professional associations paid automatically. The generalization\\ntherefore becomes “The employee may be afﬁliated with many organizations that should be automatically paid\\nfrom the employee’s paycheck.” \\nThe corresponding abstraction is the Affiliation class that is shown in Figure 18-6. That ﬁgure, however,\\ndoes not show the Employee containing more than one Affiliation, and it shows the presence of a\\nNoAffiliation class. This design does not quite ﬁt the abstraction we now think we need.

UML. When I drew the UML in Figure 19-12, I thought that replacing NoAffiliation with a\\nlist of afﬁliations was a better design. I thought it was more ﬂexible and less complex. After all, I could add new\\nafﬁliations any time I wanted, and I didn’t have to create the NoAffiliation class. However, when writing the\\ntest case in Listing 19-16, I realized that calling SetAffiliation on Employee was better than calling\\nAddAffiliation. After all, the requirements do not ask that an employee have more than one Affiliation, so\\nthere is no need to employ dynamic_cast to select between potentially many kinds. Doing so would be more\\ncomplex than necessary.\\nThis is an example of why doing too much UML without verifying it in code can be dangerous. The code\\ncan tell you things about your design that the UML cannot. Here, I was putting structures into the UML that\\nweren’t needed. Maybe one day they’d come in handy, but they have to be maintained between now and then. The\\ncost of that maintenance may not be worth the beneﬁt.\\nIn this case, even though the cost of maintaining the dynamic_cast is relatively slight, I’m not going to\\nemploy it. Its much simpler to implement without a list of Affiliation objects. So I’ll keep the NULL OBJECT\\npattern in place with the NoAffiliation class. \\nListings 19-17 and 19-18 show the implementation of the ServiceChargeTransaction. It is indeed\\nmuch simpler without the loop looking for UnionAffiliation objects. It simply gets the Employee from the\\ndatabase, downcasts its Affillation to a UnionAffilliation, and adds the ServiceCharge to it.\\nListing 19-17\\nServiceChargeTransaction.h\\n#ifndef SERVICECHARGETRANSACTION_H\\n#define SERVICECHARGETRANSACTION_H\\n#include \"Transaction.h\"\\nclass ServiceChargeTransaction : public Transaction\\n{\\n public:\\n  virtual ~ServiceChargeTransaction();\\n  ServiceChargeTransaction(int memberId, long date, double charge);\\n  virtual void Execute();\\n private:\\n  int itsMemberId;\\n  long itsDate;\\n  double itsCharge;\\n};\\n#endif\\nListing 19-18\\nServiceChargeTransaction.cpp\\n#include \"ServiceChargeTransaction.h\"\\n#include \"Employee.h\"\\n219\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

This structure is easily\\nderived from Use Case 6. All the transactions take an EmpID argu-\\nment, so we can create a top-level base class called Change-\\nEmployeeTransaction. Below this base class are the classes that\\nchange single attributes, such as ChangeNameTransaction and\\nChangeAddressTransaction. The transactions that change classi-\\nﬁcations have a commonality of purpose, in that they all modify the same ﬁeld of the Employee object. Thus, they\\ncan be grouped together under the abstract base, ChangeClassificationTransaction. The same is true of the\\ntransactions that change the payment and the afﬁliations. This can be seen by the structure of Change-\\nMethodTransaction and ChangeAffiliationTransaction.   \\nFigure 19-15 shows the dynamic model for all the change transactions. Again we see the T EMPLATE\\nMETHOD pattern in use. In every case, the Employee object corresponding to the EmpID must be retrieved from\\nthe PayrollDatabase. Thus, the Execute function of ChangeEmployeeTransaction implements this behav-\\nior and then sends the Change message to itself. This method will be declared as virtual and implemented in the\\nderivatives, as shown in Figures 19-16 and 19-17. \\nListing 19-19 shows the test case for the ChangeNameTransaction. This test case is very simple. It uses\\nthe AddHourlyEmployee transaction to create an hourly employee named Bill. It then creates and executes a\\nChangeNameTransaction that should change the employee’s name to Bob. Finally, it fetches the Employee\\ninstance from the PayrollDatabase and veriﬁes that the name has been changed.\\n220\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

The UML is only concerned with the appropriate Affiliation derivative being bound to the\\nEmployee. I didn’t notice the deﬁcit at all. Did you?\\nI merrily coded the transactions as per the diagrams and then watched the unit test fail. Once the failure\\noccurred, it was obvious what I had neglected. What was not obvious was the solution to the problem. How do I\\nget the membership to be recorded by ChangeMemberTransaction, but erased by ChangeUnaffiliated-\\nTransaction?\\nThe answer was to add another pure virtual function to ChangeAffiliationTransaction named\\nRecordMembership(Employee*). This function is implemented in ChangeMemberTransaction to bind the\\nmemberId to the Employee instance. In the ChangeUnaffiliatedTransaction it is implemented to erase the\\nmembership record.\\nListings 19-30 and 19-31 show the resulting implementation of the abstract base class Change-\\nAffiliationTransaction.

I could solve this by putting RecordMembership\\nand EraseMembership abstract methods in the Affiliation class. However, this would force\\nUnionAffiliation  and NoAffiliation to know about the PayrollDatabase. And I’m not very happy\\nabout that either. 2\\nStill, the implementation as it stands is pretty simple and only slightly violates the OCP. The nice thing is\\nthat very few modules in the system know about ChangeUnaffiliatedTransaction, so its extra dependencies\\naren’t doing very much harm.\\nPaying Employees\\nFinally, it is time to consider the transaction that is at the root of\\nthis application: the transaction that instructs the system to pay the\\nappropriate employees.

The algorithm employed by the CalculatePay\\nmessage depends on the kind of PaymentClassification that\\nthe employee object contains. The algorithm used to determine if\\na date is a payday depends on the kind of PaymentSchedule that the Employee contains. The algorithm used to\\nsend the payment to the Employee depends on the type of the PaymentMethod object. This high degree of\\nabstraction allows the algorithms to be closed against the addition of new kinds of payment classiﬁcations, sched-\\nules, afﬁliations, or payment methods.\\n2.

After the correct\\npay amount has been calculated and sent to the Employee, the payment is posted; that is, the records involved in\\nthe payment are updated. Thus, we can deﬁne the CalculatePay method as calculating the pay from the last\\nposting until the speciﬁed date.\\nDo We Want Developers Making Business Decisions?\\nWhere did this notion of posting come from? It certainly wasn’t mentioned in the user stories or use cases. As it\\nhappens, I cooked it up as a way to solve a problem that I perceived. I was concerned that the Payday method\\nmight be called multiple times with the same date, or with a date in the same pay period, so I wanted to make sure\\nthat the employee was not paid more than once. I did this on my own initiative, without asking my customer. It just\\nseemed the right thing to do.\\nIn effect, I have made a business decision. I have decided that multiple runs of the payroll program will pro-\\nduce different results. I should have asked my customer or project manager about this, since they might have very\\ndifferent ideas.\\nIn checking with the customer, I ﬁnd that the idea of posting goes against his intent.3 The customer wants to\\nbe able to run the payroll system and then review the paychecks. If any of them are wrong, the customer wants to\\ncorrect the payroll information and run the payroll program again. They tell me that I should never consider time\\ncards or sales receipts for dates outside the current pay period. \\nSo, we have to ditch the posting scheme. It seemed like a good idea at the time, but it was not what the cus-\\ntomer wanted.\\nPaying Salaried Employees\\nThere are two test cases in Listing 19-36. They test whether a salaried employee is being paid appropriately. The\\nﬁrst test case makes sure the employee is paid on the last day of the month. The second test case makes sure the\\nemployee is not paid if it is not the last day of the month. \\nListing 19-36\\nPayrollTest::TestPaySingleSalariedEmployee & co.\\nvoid PayrollTest::TestPaySingleSalariedEmployee()\\n{\\n  cerr << \"TestPaySingleSalariedEmployee\" << endl;\\n  int empId = 1;\\n  AddSalariedEmployee t(empId, \"Bob\", \"Home\", 1000.00);\\n  t.Execute();\\n  Date payDate(11,30,2001);\\n  PaydayTransaction pt(payDate);\\n  pt.Execute();\\n  Paycheck* pc = pt.GetPaycheck(empId);\\n  assert(pc);\\n  assert(pc->GetPayDate() == payDate);\\n  assertEquals(1000.00, pc->GetGrossPay(), .001);\\n  assert(\"Hold\" == pc->GetField(\"Disposition\"));\\n  assertEquals(0.0, pc->GetDeductions(), .001);\\n  assertEquals(1000.00, pc->GetNetPay(), .001);\\n}\\n3.

So I dug through my\\narchives and found it on an old sparcstation that I had laying around.4 I moved it to my development environment\\nand managed to get it to compile in minutes. I found this surprising, since I had written it to work in Linux, but was\\nnow using it in Windows 2000. There were a couple of small bugs to ﬁx, and I had to replace my homegrown\\nstring class with the STL string class, but in the end the effort was minimal.\\nListing 19-37 shows the Execute() function of PaydayTransaction. It iterates through all the\\nEmployee objects in the database. It asks each employee if the date on this transaction is its pay date.

What should I put there? The user stories tell me that union\\ndues are weekly, but salaried employees are paid monthly. How many weeks are in each month? Should I just mul-\\ntiply the dues by four? That’s not very accurate. I’ll ask the customer what he wants.5\\nThe customer tells me that union dues are accrued every Friday. So what I need to do is count the number of\\nFridays in the pay period and multiply by the weekly dues. There are ﬁve Fridays in November, 2001—the month\\nthat the test case is written for. So I can modify the test case appropriately.\\n5. And so Bob talks to himself yet again. Go to www.google.com/groups and look up “Schizophrenic Robert Martin.”\\n241\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

I have done this calculation before in the function IsInPayPeriod in Listing 19-45 (and you\\nprobably wrote a similar one for the CommissionedClassification). This function is used by the\\nCalculatePay function of the HourlyClassification object to ensure that only time cards from the pay\\nperiod are tallied. Now it seems that the UnionAffiliation object must call this function too.\\nBut wait! What is this function doing in the HourlyClassification class? We’ve already determined that\\nthe association between the payment schedule and the payment classiﬁcation is accidental. The function that deter-\\nmines the pay period ought to be in the PaymentSchedule class, not in the PaymentClassification class!\\nIt is interesting that our UML diagrams didn’t help us catch this problem. The problem only surfaced when I\\nstarted thinking about the test cases for UnionAffiliation. This is yet another example of how necessary cod-\\ning feedback is to any design. Diagrams can be useful, but reliance on them without feedback from the code is\\nrisky business.\\nSo how do we get the pay period out of the PaymentSchedule hierarchy and into the Payment-\\nClassification and Affiliation hierarchies? These hierarchies do not know anything about each other. We\\ncould put the pay period dates into the Paycheck object. Right now, the Paycheck just has the end date of the pay\\nperiod. We ought to be able to get the start date in there, too.\\nListing 19-48 shows the change made to PaydayTransaction::Execute(). Notice that when the\\nPaycheck is created, it is passed both the start and end dates of the pay period. If you jump ahead to Listing 19-55\\nyou will see that it is the PaymentSchedule that calculates both. The changes to Paycheck should be obvious. \\nListing 19-48\\nPaydayTransaction::Execute()\\nvoid PaydayTransaction::Execute()\\n{\\n  list<int> empIds;\\n  GpayrollDatabase.GetAllEmployeeIds(empIds);\\n  list<int>::iterator i = empIds.begin();\\n  for (; i != empIds.end(); i++) {\\n    int empId = *i;\\n    if (Employee* e = GpayrollDatabase.GetEmployee(empId)) {\\n      if (e->IsPayDate(itsPayDate)) {\\n        Paycheck* pc = \\n          new Paycheck(e->GetPayPeriodStartDate(itsPayDate), itsPayDate);\\n        itsPaychecks[empId] = pc;\\n        e->Payday(*pc);\\n      }\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\nThe two functions in HourlyClassification and CommissionedClassification that determined if\\nTimeCards and SalesReceipts were within the pay period have been merged and moved into the base class\\nPaymentClassification.

Figures 19-34 and 19-35 describe the statics and dynamics of the main program. The concept is\\nsimple: the PayrollApplication sits in a loop, alternately requesting transactions from the Transaction-\\nSource and then telling those Transaction objects to Execute. Note that this is different from the diagram in\\nFigure 19-1, and it represents a shift in our thinking to a more abstract mechanism.\\nFigure 19-34 Static Model for the Main Program\\n«interface»\\nTransaction\\nSource\\n«interface»\\nTransaction\\n+ GetTransaction\\nTextParser\\nTransaction\\nSource\\nPayroll\\nApplication\\nFigure 19-35 Dynamic Model for the Main Program\\nPayroll\\nApplication\\nt := GetTransaction()\\nTransaction\\nSource\\nt:Transaction\\nExecute()\\nTransactionSource is an abstract class that we can implement in several ways. The static diagram shows\\nthe derivative named TextParserTransactionSource, which reads an incoming text stream and parses out the\\ntransactions as described in the use cases. This object then creates the appropriate Transaction objects and\\nsends them along to the PayrollApplication.\\nThe separation of interface from implementation in the TransactionSource allows the source of\\nthe transactions to be abstract; for example, we could easily interface the PayrollApplication to a\\nGUITransactionSource or a RemoteTransactionSource.\\nThe Database\\nNow that this iteration has been analyzed, designed, and (mostly) implemented, we can consider the role of the\\ndatabase. The class PayrollDatabase clearly encapsulates something involving persistence. The objects con-\\ntained within the PayrollDatabase must live longer than any particular run of the application. How should this\\nbe implemented? Clearly the transient mechanism used by the test cases is not sufﬁcient for the real system. We\\nhave several options. \\nWe could implement PayrollDatabase using an object-oriented database management system\\n(OODBMS). This would allow the actual objects to reside within the permanent storage of the database. As\\ndesigners, we would have little more work to do, since the OODBMS would not add much new to our design. One\\nof the great beneﬁts of OODBMS products is that they have little or no impact on the object model of the applica-\\ntions. As far as the design is concerned, the database barely exists.6\\nAnother option would be to use a simple, ﬂat text ﬁle to record the data. Upon initialization, the\\nPayrollDatabase object could read that ﬁle and build the necessary objects in memory. At the end of the pro-\\ngram, the PayrollDatabase object could write a new version of the text ﬁle. Certainly this option would not suf-\\nﬁce for a company with hundreds of thousands of employees, or for one that wanted real-time concurrent access to\\n6. This is optimistic. In a simple application like Payroll, the use of an OODBMS would have very little impact upon the design of the \\nprogram. As applications become more and more complicated, the amount of impact that the OODBMS has upon the application \\nincreases. Still, the impact is far less than the impact an RDBMS would have.\\n248\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

We also do\\nnot tie ourselves to any particular database technology or product. We have the freedom to choose the database we\\nneed, based upon the rest of the design, and we maintain the freedom to change or replace that database product in\\nthe future as needed.\\nSummary of Payroll Design\\nIn roughly 50 diagrams, and 3300 lines of code, we have shown the design and implementation of one iteration of\\nthe payroll application. The design employs a large amount of abstraction and polymorphism. The result is that\\nlarge portions of the design are closed against changes of payroll policy. For example, the application could be\\nchanged to deal with employees who were paid quarterly based upon a normal salary and a bonus schedule. This\\nchange would require addition to the design, but little of the existing design and code would change. \\nDuring this process, we rarely considered whether we were performing analysis, design, or implementation.\\nInstead, we concentrated upon issues of clarity and closure. We tried to ﬁnd the underlying abstractions wherever\\npossible. The result is that we have a good starting design for a payroll application, and we have a core of classes\\nthat are germane to the problem domain as a whole. \\nHistory\\nThe diagrams in this chapter are derived from the Booch diagrams in the corresponding chapter of my 1995 book\\nDesigning Object-Oriented C++ Applications using the Booch Method. Those diagrams were created in 1994. As\\nI created them, I also wrote some of the code that implemented them, to make sure that the diagrams made sense.\\nHowever, I did not write anywhere near the amount of code presented here. Therefore, the diagrams did not beneﬁt\\nfrom signiﬁcant feedback from the code and tests. This lack of feedback shows.\\nI wrote the current chapter in the order presented here. In every case, test cases were written before produc-\\ntion code. In many cases, those tests were created incrementally, evolving as the production code also evolved. The\\nproduction code was written to comply with the diagrams so long as that made sense. There were several cases\\nwhere it did not make sense, and so I changed the design of the code.\\nOne of the ﬁrst places that this happened was back on page 219 when I decided against multiple\\nAffiliation instances in the Employee object. Another was on page 229 when I found that I had not considered\\nrecording the employee’s membership in the union in the ChangeMemberTransaction.\\nThis is normal. When you design without feedback, you will necessarily make errors. It was the feedback\\nimposed by the tests cases and running code that found these errors for us. \\n7. Sometimes the nature of the database is one of the requirements of the application. RDBMSs provide powerful query and reporti ng sys-\\ntems that may be listed as application requirements. However, even when such requirements are explicit, the designers should still \\ndecouple the application design from the database design. The application design should not have to depend on any particular kind of \\ndatabase.\\n249\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

The last three govern the interrelationships between\\npackages.\\nGranularity: The Principles of Package Cohesion\\nThe three principles of package cohesion help developers decide how to partition classes into packages. They\\ndepend on the fact that at least some of the classes and their interrelationships have been discovered. Thus, these\\nprinciples take a “bottom-up” view of partitioning.\\nThe Reuse–Release Equivalence Principle (REP)\\nThe granule of reuse is the granule of release. \\nWhat do you expect from the author of a class library that you are planning to reuse? Certainly you want good doc-\\numentation, working code, well-speciﬁed interfaces, etc. But there are other things you want, too.\\nFirst of all, to make it worth your while to reuse this person’s code, you want the author to guarantee to\\nmaintain it for you. After all, if you have to maintain it, you are going to have to invest a tremendous amount of\\ntime into it—time that might be better spent designing a smaller and better package for yourself.\\nSecond, you are going to want the author to notify you in advance of any changes he plans to make to the\\ninterface and functionality of the code. But notiﬁcation is not enough. The author must give you the option to\\nrefuse to use any new versions. After all, he might introduce a new version while you are in a severe schedule\\ncrunch, or he might make changes to the code that are simply incompatible with your system.\\nIn either case, should you decide to reject his version, the author must guarantee to support your use of the\\nold version for a time. Perhaps that time is as short as three months or as long as a year; that is something for the\\ntwo of you to negotiate. But he can’t just cut you loose and refuse to support you. If he won’t agree to support your\\nuse of his older versions, then you may have to seriously consider whether you want to use his code and be subject\\nto his capricious changes.\\nThis issue is primarily political. It has to do with the clerical and support effort that must be provided if other\\npeople are going to reuse code. But those political and clerical issues have a profound effect on the packaging\\nstructure of software. In order to provide the guarantees that reusers need, authors must organize their software\\ninto reusable packages and then track those packages with release numbers.\\nThe REP states that the granule of reuse (i.e., a package) can be no smaller than the granule of release. Any-\\nthing that we reuse must also be released and tracked. It is not realistic for a developer to simply write a class and\\nthen claim it is reusable. Reusability comes only after there is a tracking system in place that offers the guarantees\\nof notiﬁcation, safety, and support that the potential reusers will need.\\n254\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

Since reusability must be based\\non packages, reusable packages must contain reusable classes. So, at least some packages should comprise reus-\\nable sets of classes.\\nIt may seem disquieting that a political force would affect the partitioning of our software, but software is\\nnot a mathematically pure entity that can be structured according to mathematically pure rules. Software is a\\nhuman product that supports human endeavors. Software is created and used by humans. And if software is going\\nto be reused, then it must be partitioned in a manner that humans ﬁnd convenient for that purpose.\\nSo what does this tell us about the internal structure of a package? One must consider the internal contents\\nfrom the point of view of potential reusers. If a package contains software that should be reused, then it should not\\nalso contain software that is not designed for reuse. Either all of the classes in a package are reusable or none of\\nthem are.\\nReusability is not the only criterion; we must also consider who the reuser is. Certainly, a container-class\\nlibrary is reusable, and so is a ﬁnancial framework. But we would not want them to be part of the same pack-\\nage. There are many people who would like to reuse a container-class library who have no interest in a ﬁnancial\\nframework. Thus, we want all of the classes in a package to be reusable by the same audience. We do not want\\nan audience to ﬁnd that a package consists of some classes he needs and others that are wholly inappropriate\\nfor him.\\nThe Common-Reuse Principle (CRP)\\nThe classes in a package are reused together. If you reuse one of the classes in a package, you reuse\\nthem all.\\nThis principle helps us to decide which classes should be placed into a package. It states that classes that tend to be\\nreused together belong in the same package.\\nClasses are seldom reused in isolation. Generally, reusable classes collaborate with other classes that are part\\nof the reusable abstraction. The CRP states that these classes belong together in the same package. In such a pack-\\nage, we would expect to see classes that have lots of dependencies on each other. \\nA simple example might be a container class and its associated iterators. These classes are reused together\\nbecause they are tightly coupled to each other. Thus, they ought to be in the same package.\\nBut the CRP tells us more than just what classes to put together into a package. It also tells us what classes\\nnot to put in the package. When one package uses another, a dependency is created between the packages. It may\\nbe that the using package only uses one class within the used package. However, that doesn’t weaken the depen-\\ndency at all. The using package still depends on the used package. Every time the used package is released, the\\nusing package must be revalidated and rereleased. This is true even if the used package is being released because\\nof changes to a class that the using package doesn’t care about.\\nMoreover, it is common for packages to have physical representations as shared libraries, DLLs, JARs. If the\\nused package is released as a JAR, then the using code depends on the entire JAR. Any modiﬁcation to that JAR—\\neven if the modiﬁcation is to a class that the using code does not care about—will still cause a new version of the\\nJAR to be released. The new JAR will still have to be redistributed, and the using code will still have to be\\nrevalidated.\\nThus, I want to make sure that when I depend on a package, I depend on every class in that package. To say\\nthis another way, I want to make sure that the classes that I put into a package are inseparable, that it is impossible\\nto depend on some and not the others. Otherwise, I will be revalidating and redistributing more than is necessary,\\nand I will waste signiﬁcant effort.\\nTherefore, the CRP tells us more about what classes shouldn’t be together than what classes should be\\ntogether. The CRP says that classes which are not tightly bound to each other with class relationships should not\\nbe in the same package.\\n255\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

A change that\\naffects a package affects all the classes in that package and no other packages.\\nThis is the Single-Responsibility Principle restated for packages. Just as the SRP says that a class should not con-\\ntain multiples reasons to change, this principle says that a package should not have multiple reasons to change.\\nIn most applications, maintainability is more important that reusability. If the code in an application must\\nchange, you would rather that the changes occur all in one package, rather than being distributed through many\\npackages. If changes are focused into a single package, then we need only release the one changed package. Other\\npackages that don’t depend on the changed package do not need to be revalidated or rereleased. \\nThe CCP prompts us to gather together in one place all the classes that are likely to change for the same rea-\\nsons. If two classes are so tightly bound, either physically or conceptually, that they always change together, then\\nthey belong in the same package. This minimizes the workload related to releasing, revalidating, and redistributing\\nthe software.\\nThis principle is closely associated with the Open–Closed Principle (OCP). For it is “closure” in the OCP\\nsense of the word that this principle is dealing with. The OCP states that classes should be closed for modiﬁcation\\nbut open for extension. But as we learned, 100% closure is not attainable. Closure must be strategic. We design our\\nsystems such that they are closed to the most common kinds of changes that we have experienced.\\nThe CCP ampliﬁes this by grouping together classes that are open to certain types of changes into the same\\npackages. Thus, when a change in requirements comes along, that change has a good chance of being restricted to\\na minimal number of packages.\\nSummary of Package Cohesion\\nIn the past, our view of cohesion was much simpler than the last three principles have implied. We used to think\\nthat cohesion was simply the attribute of a module to perform one, and only one, function. However, the three prin-\\nciples of package cohesion describe a richer variety of cohesion. In choosing the classes to group together into\\npackages, we must consider the opposing forces involved in reusability and developability. Balancing these forces\\nwith the needs of the application is nontrivial. Moreover, the balance is almost always dynamic. That is, the parti-\\ntioning that is appropriate today might not be appropriate next year. Thus, the composition of the packages will\\nlikely jitter and evolve with time as the focus of the project changes from developability to reusability.\\nStability: The Principles of Package Coupling\\nThe next three principles deal with the relationships between\\npackages. Here again, we will run into the tension between\\ndevelopability and logical design. The forces that impinge on the\\narchitecture of a package structure are technical, political, and\\nvolatile. \\nThe Acyclic-Dependencies Principle (ADP)\\nAllow no cycles in the package-dependency graph.\\nHave you ever worked all day, gotten some stuff working and then gone home, only to arrive the next morning at to\\nﬁnd that your stuff no longer works?

It works like this: All the developers ignore each other for\\nthe ﬁrst four days of the week. They all work on private copies of the code and don’t worry about integrating with\\neach other. Then, on Friday, they integrate all their changes and build the system.\\nThis has the wonderful advantage of allowing the developers to live in an isolated world for four days out of\\nﬁve. The disadvantage, of course, is the large integration penalty that is paid on Friday.\\nUnfortunately, as the project grows, it becomes less feasible to ﬁnish integrating on Friday. The integration\\nburden grows until it starts to overﬂow into Saturday. A few such Saturdays are enough to convince the developers\\nthat integration should really begin on Thursday. And so the start of integration slowly creeps toward the middle of\\nthe week. \\nAs the duty cycle of development vs. integration decreases, the efﬁciency of the team decreases, too. Eventu-\\nally this becomes so frustrating that the developers, or the project managers, declare that the schedule should be\\nchanged to a biweekly build. This sufﬁces for a time, but the integration time continues to grow with project size.\\nThis eventually leads to a crisis. To maintain efﬁciency, the build schedule has to be continually lengthened.\\nYet lengthening the build schedule increases project risks. Integration and testing become harder and harder to do,\\nand the team loses the beneﬁt of rapid feedback.\\nEliminating Dependency Cycles\\nThe solution to this problem is to partition the development environment into releasable packages. The packages\\nbecome units of work, which can be checked out by a developer or a team of developers. When developers get a\\npackage working, they release it for use by the other developers. They give it a release number and move it into a\\ndirectory for other teams to use. They then continue to modify their package in their own private areas. Everyone\\nelse uses the released version.\\nAs new releases of a package are made, other teams can decide whether or not to immediately adopt the new\\nrelease. If they decide not to, they simply continue using the old release. Once they decide that they are ready, they\\nbegin to use the new release.\\nThus, none of the teams is at the mercy of the others. Changes made to one package do not need to have an\\nimmediate effect on other teams. Each team can decide for itself when to adapt its packages to new releases of the\\npackages they use. Moreover, integration happens in small increments. There is no single point in time when all\\ndevelopers must come together and integrate everything they are doing.\\nThis is a very simple and rational process, and it is widely used. However, to make it work you must manage\\nthe dependency structure of the packages. There can be no cycles. If there are cycles in the dependency structure,\\nthen the morning-after syndrome cannot be avoided. \\nConsider the package diagram in Figure 20-1. Here we see a rather typical structure of packages assembled\\ninto an application. The function of this application is unimportant for the purpose of this example. What is impor-\\ntant is the dependency structure of the packages. Notice that this structure is a directed graph. The packages are\\nthe nodes, and the dependency relationships are the directed edges. \\n257\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

Regardless of the package at which you begin, it is impossible to follow the\\ndependency relationships and wind up back at that package. This structures has no cycles. It is a directed acyclic\\ngraph. (DAG).\\nWhen the team responsible for MyDialogs makes a new release of their package it is easy to ﬁnd out who is\\naffected; you just follow the dependency arrows backwards. Thus, MyTasks and MyApplication are both going\\nto be affected. The developers currently working on those packages will have to decide when they should integrate\\nwith the new release of MyDialogs.\\nNotice also that when MyDialogs is released, it has utterly no effect on many of the other packages in the\\nsystem. They don’t know about MyDialogs, and they don’t care when it changes. This is nice. It means that the\\nimpact of releasing MyDialogs is relatively small. \\nWhen the developers working on the MyDialogs package would like to run a test of that package, all they\\nneed do is compile and link their version of MyDialogs with the version of the Windows package that they are\\ncurrently using. None of the other packages in the system needs to be involved. This is nice; it means that the\\ndevelopers working on MyDialogs have relatively little work to do to set up a test, and that there are relatively few\\nvariables for them to consider.\\nWhen it is time to release the whole system, it is done from the bottom up. First the Windows package is\\ncompiled, tested, and released. Next are MessageWindow and MyDialogs. These are followed by Task and then\\nTaskWindow and Database. MyTasks is next, and ﬁnally MyApplication. This process is very clear and easy\\nto deal with. We know how to build the system because we understand the dependencies between its parts.\\nThe Effect of a Cycle in the Package Dependency Graph\\nLet us say that the a new requirement forces us to change one of the classes in MyDialogs such that it makes use\\nof a class in MyApplication. This creates a dependency cycle as shown in Figure 20-2.\\nThis cycle creates some immediate problems. For example, the developers working on the MyTasks package\\nknow that in order to release, they must be compatible with Task, MyDialogs, Database, and Windows. How-\\never, with the cycle in place, they must now also be compatible with MyApplication, TaskWindow, and\\nMessageWindow. That is, MyTasks now depends on every other package in the system. This makes MyTasks very\\ndifﬁcult to release. MyDialogs suffers the same fate. In fact, the cycle forces MyApplication, MyTasks, and\\nMyDialogs to always be released at the same time. They have, in effect, become one large package. And all the\\ndevelopers who are working in any of those packages will experience the morning-after syndrome once again.\\nFigure 20-1 Package Structures are a Directed Acyclic Graph\\nMessage\\nWindow\\nTask\\nWindow MyTasks\\nDatabase\\nTasks\\nWindows\\nMyApplication\\nMyDialogs\\n258\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

Consider what happens when we want to test the Mydialogs package. We\\nﬁnd that we must link in every other package in the system, including the Database package. This means that we\\nhave to do a complete build just to test MyDialogs. This is intolerable.\\nIf you have ever wondered why you have to link in so many different libraries, and so much of everybody\\nelse’s stuff, just to run a simple unit test of one of your classes, it is probably because there are cycles in the depen-\\ndency graph. Such cycles make it very difﬁcult to isolate modules. Unit testing and releasing become very difﬁcult\\nand error prone. And, in C++, compile times grow geometrically with the number of modules. \\nMoreover, when there are cycles in the dependency graph, it can be very difﬁcult to work out the order in\\nwhich to build the packages. Indeed, there may be no correct order. This can lead to some very nasty problems in\\nlanguages like Java that read their declarations from compiled binary ﬁles.\\nBreaking the Cycle\\nIt is always possible to break a cycle of packages and reinstate the dependency graph as a DAG. There are two pri-\\nmary mechanisms. \\n1. Apply the Dependency-Inversion Principle (DIP). In the case of Figure 20-3, we could create an abstract \\nbase class that has the interface that MyDialogs needs. We could then put that abstract base into \\nMyDialogs and inherit it into MyApplication. This inverts the dependency between MyDialogs and \\nMyApplication, thus breaking the cycle. (See Figure 20-3.)\\nNotice, once again, that we named the interface after the client rather than the server. This is yet \\nanother application of the rule that interfaces belong to clients.\\n2. Create a new package on which both MyDialogs and MyApplication depend. Move the class(es) that they \\nboth depend on into that new package. (See Figure 20-4.)\\nThe “Jitters”\\nThe second solution implies that the package structure is volatile in the presence of changing requirements.\\nIndeed, as the application grows, the package dependency structure jitters and grows. Thus, the dependency struc-\\nture must always be monitored for cycles. When cycles occur, they must be broken somehow. Sometimes this will\\nmean creating new packages, making the dependency structure grow.\\nFigure 20-2 A Package Diagram with a Cycle\\nMessage\\nWindow\\nTask\\nWindow MyTasks\\nDatabase\\nTasks\\nWindows\\nMyApplication\\nMyDialogs\\n259\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

The package structure cannot be designed\\nfrom the top down. This means that it is not one of the ﬁrst things about the system that is designed. Indeed, it\\nseems that it evolves as the system grows and changes.\\nYou may ﬁnd this to be counterintuitive. We have come to expect that large-grained decompositions, like\\npackages, are also high-level functional decompositions. When we see a large-grained grouping like a package\\ndependency structure, we feel that the packages ought to somehow represent the functions of the system. Yet this\\ndoes not seem to be an attribute of package dependency diagrams.\\nIn fact, package dependency diagrams have very little do to with describing the function of the application.\\nInstead, they are a map to the buildability of the application. This is why they aren’t designed at the start of the\\nproject. There is no software to build, and so there is no need for a build map. But as more and more classes accu-\\nmulate in the early stages of implementation and design, there is a growing need to manage the dependencies so\\nthat the project can be developed without the morning-after syndrome. Moreover, we want to keep changes as\\nlocalized as possible, so we start paying attention to the SRP and CCP and collocate classes that are likely to\\nchange together.\\nAs the application continues to grow, we start becoming concerned about creating reusable elements.

We would not know much about common closure, we would be unaware of any reusable\\nelements, and we would almost certainly create packages that produce dependency cycles. Thus, the package\\ndependency structure grows and evolves with the logical design of the system.\\nThe Stable-Dependencies Principle (SDP)\\nDepend in the direction of stability.\\nDesigns cannot be completely static. Some volatility is necessary if the design is to be maintained. We accomplish\\nthis by conforming to the Common-Closure Principle (CCP). Using this principle, we create packages that are sen-\\nsitive to certain kinds of changes. These packages are designed to be volatile. We expect them to change. \\nAny package that we expect to be volatile should not be depended on by a package that is difﬁcult to change!\\nOtherwise the volatile package will also be difﬁcult to change.\\nIt is the perversity of software that a module that you have designed to be easy to change can be made hard\\nto change by someone else simply hanging a dependency on it. Not a line of source code in your module need\\nchange, and yet your module will suddenly be hard to change. By conforming to the SDP, we ensure that modules\\nthat are intended to be easy to change are not depended on by modules that are harder to change than they are.\\nStability\\nStand a penny on its side. Is it stable in that position? You’d likely say that it was not. However, unless disturbed, it\\nwill remain in that position for a very long time. Thus, stability has nothing directly to do with frequency of\\nchange. The penny is not changing, but it is hard to think of it as stable.\\nWebster says that something is stable if it is “not easily moved.”1 Stability is related to the amount of work\\nrequired to make a change. The penny is not stable because it requires very little work to topple it. On the other\\nhand, a table is very stable because it takes a considerable amount of effort to turn it over. \\nHow does this relate to software? There are many factors that make a software package hard to change: its\\nsize, complexity, clarity, etc. We are going to ignore all those factors and focus on something different. One sure\\nway to make a software package difﬁcult to change is to make lots of other software packages depend on it. A\\npackage with lots of incoming dependencies is very stable because it requires a great deal of work to reconcile any\\nchanges with all the dependent packages.\\nFigure 20-5 shows X, a stable package. This package has three packages depending on it; and therefore, it\\nhas three good reasons not to change. We say that it is responsible to those three packages. On the other hand, X\\ndepends on nothing, so it has no external inﬂuence to make it change. We say it is independent.\\n1.

We ﬁnd that there are three classes out-\\nside Pc that depend on classes in Pc. Thus Ca = 3. Moreover, there is one class outside Pc that classes in Pc\\ndepend on. Thus, Ce = 1, and I = 1/4.\\nIn C++, these dependencies are typically represented by #include statements. Indeed, the I metric is easi-\\nest to calculate when you have organized your source code such that there is one class in each source ﬁle. In Java,\\nthe I metric can be calculated by counting import statements and qualiﬁed names.\\nWhen the I metric is 1, it means that no other package depends on this package ( Ca = 0); and this package\\ndoes depend on other packages (Ce > 0).

It is responsible and independent. Such a pack-\\nage is as stable as it can get. Its dependents make it hard to change, and it has no dependencies that might force it\\nto change.\\nThe SDP says that the I metric of a package should be larger than the I metrics of the packages that it\\ndepends on (i.e., I metrics should decrease in the direction of dependency).\\nNot All Packages Should Be Stable\\nIf all the packages in a system were maximally stable, the system would be unchangeable. This is not a desirable\\nsituation. Indeed, we want to design our package structure so that some packages are instable and some are stable.\\nFigure 20-8 shows an ideal conﬁguration for a system with three packages.\\nThe changeable packages are on top and depend on the stable package at the bottom. Putting the instable\\npackages at the top of the diagram is a useful convention since any arrow that points up is violating the SDP.\\nFigure 20-9 shows how the SDP can be violated. Flexible is a package that we intend to be easy to change.\\nWe want Flexible to be instable. However, some developer, working in the package named Stable, hung a\\ndependency on Flexible. This violates the SDP since the I metric for Stable is much lower than the I metric for\\nFlexible. As a result, Flexible will no longer be easy to change. A change to Flexible will force us to deal\\nwith Stable and all its dependents.\\nTo ﬁx this, we somehow have to break the dependence of Stable on Flexible. Why does this dependency\\nexist? Let’s assume that there is a class C within Flexible, that another class U within Stable needs to use. (See\\nFigure 20-10.)\\nWe can ﬁx this by employing the DIP. We create an interface class called IU and put it in a package named\\nUInterface. We make sure that this interface declares all the methods that U needs to use. We then make C inherit\\nfrom this interface. (See Figure 20-11.) This breaks the dependency of Stable on Flexible and forces both\\npackages to be dependent on UInterface. UInterface is very stable ( I = 0), and Flexible retains its neces-\\nsary instability (I = 1).

This principle tells us\\nthat it is possible and desirable to create classes that are ﬂexible enough to be extended without requiring modiﬁca-\\ntion. What kind of classes conforms to this principle? Abstract classes. \\nThe Stable-Abstractions Principle (SAP)\\nA package should be as abstract as it is stable.\\nThis principle sets up a relationship between stability and abstractness. It says that a stable package should also be\\nabstract so that its stability does not prevent it from being extended. On the other hand, it says that an instable\\npackage should be concrete since its instability allows the concrete code within it to be easily changed.\\nThus, if a package is to be stable, it should also consist of abstract classes so that it can be extended.

Either a\\nclass is abstract or it is not. The combination of the SDP and SAP deals with packages and allows that a package\\ncan be partially abstract and partially stable. \\nMeasuring Abstraction\\nThe A metric is a measure of the abstractness of a package.

We can create a graph\\nwith A on the vertical axis and I on the horizontal axis. If we plot the two “good” kinds of packages on this graph,\\nwe will ﬁnd the packages that are maximally stable and abstract at the upper left at (0,1). The packages that are\\nmaximally instable and concrete are at the lower right at (1,0). (See Figure 20-12.)\\nNot all packages can fall into one of these two positions. Packages have degrees of abstraction and stability.\\nFor example, it is very common for one abstract class to derive from another abstract class. The derivative is an\\nabstraction that has a dependency. Thus, though it is maximally abstract, it will not be maximally stable. Its depen-\\ndency will decrease its stability.\\nSince we cannot enforce that all packages sit at either (0,1) or (1,0), we must assume that there is a locus of\\npoints on the A/I graph that deﬁnes reasonable positions for packages.

An example\\nwould be a database schema. Database schemas are notoriously volatile, extremely concrete, and highly depended\\non. This is one of the reasons that the interface between OO applications and databases is so difﬁcult and that\\nschema updates are generally painful. \\nAnother example of a package that sits on (0,0) is a package that holds a concrete utility library. Although\\nsuch a package has an I metric of 1, it may in fact be nonvolatile. Consider a “string” package for example. Even\\nthough all the classes within it are concrete, it is nonvolatile. Such packages are harmless in the (0,0) zone since\\nthey are not likely to be changed. Indeed, we can consider a third axis of the graph being that of volatility. If so, the\\ngraph in Figure 20-13 shows the plane at volatility = 1. \\nConsider a package near (1,1). This location is undesirable because it is maximally abstract and yet has no\\ndependents. Such packages are useless. Thus, this is called the Zone of Uselessness. \\nIt seems clear that we’d like our volatile packages to be as far from both zones of exclusion as possible. The\\nlocus of points that is maximally distant from each zone is the line that connects (1,0) and (0,1). This line is known\\nas the main sequence.2\\nA package that sits on the main sequence is not “too abstract” for its stability, nor is it “too instable” for its\\nabstractness. It is neither useless, nor particularly painful. It is depended on to the extent that it is abstract, and it\\ndepends on others to the extent that it is concrete. \\nClearly, the most desirable positions for a package to hold are at one of the two endpoints of the main\\nsequence. However, in my experience less than half the packages in a project can have such ideal characteristics.\\nThose other packages have the best characteristics if they are on or close to the main sequence.\\nDistance from the Main Sequence\\nThis leads us to our last metric. If it is desirable for packages to be on or close to the main sequence, we can create\\na metric which measures how far away a package is from this ideal.\\nD— Distance.\\n.\\nThis metric ranges from [0,~0.707].\\nFigure 20-13 Zones of Exclusion\\n2.

This is an extreme that I don’t recommend. \\nI don’t start out using factories. I only put them into the system when the need for them becomes great\\nenough. For example, if it becomes necessary to use the PROXY pattern, then it will probably become necessary to\\nuse a factory to create the persistent objects.

The four are the two interface classes that\\nrepresent the new class and its factory and the two concrete classes that implement those interfaces. \\nConclusion\\nFactories are powerful tools. They can be of great beneﬁt in conforming to the DIP. They allow high-level policy\\nmodules to create instances of classes without depending on the concrete implementations of those classes. They\\nalso make it possible to swap in completely different families of implementations for a group of classes. However,\\nfactories are a complexity that can often be avoided.

Note that the TextParserTransactionSource class is in another package that\\ndepends on the abstract PayrollApplication class. This creates an upside-down structure in which the details\\ndepend on the generalities, and the generalities are independent. This conforms to the DIP.\\nThe most striking case of generality and independence is the PayrollDomain package. This package\\ncontains the essence of the whole system, yet it depends on nothing! Examine this package carefully. It\\ncontains Employee, PaymentClassification, PaymentMethod, PaymentSchedule, Affiliation, and\\nTransaction. This package contains all of the major abstractions in our model, yet it has no dependencies.\\nWhy? Because nearly all of the classes it contains are abstract.\\nConsider the Classifications package, which contains the three derivatives of PaymentClassification.\\nIt also contains the ChangeClassificationTransaction class and its three derivatives, along with TimeCard and\\nSalesReceipt. Notice that any change made to these nine classes is isolated; other than TextParser, no other pack-\\nage is affected! Such isolation also holds for the Methods package, the Schedules package, and the Affiliations\\npackage. This is quite a bit of isolation.\\nNotice that the bulk of the executable code is in packages that have few or no dependents. Since almost noth-\\ning depends on them, we call them irresponsible. The code within those packages is tremendously ﬂexible; it can\\nbe changed without affecting many other parts of the project. Notice also that the most general packages of the\\nsystem contain the least amount of executable code. These packages are heavily depended on, but depend on noth-\\ning. Since many packages depend on them, we call them responsible, and since they don’t depend on anything, we\\ncall them independent. Thus, the amount of responsible code (i.e., code in which changes would affect lots of other\\ncode) is very small. Moreover, that small amount of responsible code is also independent, which means that no\\nother modules will induce it to change. This upside-down structure, with highly independent and responsible gen-\\neralities at the bottom, and highly irresponsible and dependent details at the top, is the hallmark of object-oriented\\ndesign.\\nContrast Figure 22-1 with Figure 22-2. Notice that the details at the bottom of Figure 22-1 are independent\\nand highly responsible. This is the wrong place for details! Details should depend on the major architectural deci-\\nsions of the system and should not be depended on. Notice also that the generalities, the packages that deﬁne the\\narchitecture of the system, are irresponsible and highly dependent. Thus, the packages that deﬁne the architectural\\ndecisions depend on, and are thus constrained by, the packages that contain the implementation details. This is a\\nviolation of the SAP. It would be better if the architecture constrained the details!\\nApplying the Reuse–Release Equivalency Principle (REP)\\nWhat portions of the payroll application can we reuse? If another division of our company wanted to reuse our\\npayroll system, but they had a completely different set of policies, they could not reuse Classifications,\\nMethods, Schedules, or Affiliations. However, they could reuse PayrollDomain, Payroll-\\nApplication, Application, PayrollDatabase, and possibly PDImplementation. On the other hand, if\\nanother department wanted to write software that analyzed the current employee database, they could reuse\\nPayrollDomain, Classifications, Methods, Schedules, Affiliations, PayrollDatabase, and\\nPDImplementation. In each case, the granule of reuse is a package. \\nSeldom, if ever, would only a single class from a package be reused. The reason is simple: the classes within\\na package should be cohesive. That means that they depend on one another and cannot be easily or sensibly sepa-\\nrated. It would make no sense, for example, to use the Employee class without using the PaymentMethod class.\\nIn fact, in order to do so, you would have to modify the Employee class so that it did not contain a\\nPaymentMethod class. Certainly we don’t want to support the kind of reuse that forces us to modify the reused\\ncomponents. Therefore, the granule of reuse is the package. This gives us another cohesion criterion to employ\\nwhen trying to group classes into packages: not only should the classes be closed together, they should also be\\nreusable together in conformance with the REP.\\n278\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

The packages that we might like to reuse, like\\nTransactions or PayrollDatabase, are not easily reusable because they drag along a lot of extra baggage.\\nThe PayrollApplication package is horribly dependent (it depends on everything). If we wanted to create a\\nnew payroll application that used a different set of schedule, method, afﬁliation, and classiﬁcation policies, we\\nwould not be able to use this package as a whole. Instead, we would have to take individual classes from\\nPayrollApplication, Transactions, Methods, Schedules, Classifications, and Affiliations. By\\ndisassembling the packages in this way, we destroy their release structure. We cannot say that Release 3.2 of\\nPayrollApplication is reusable. \\nFigure 22-1 violates the CRP. Thus, having accepted the reusable fragments of our various packages, the\\nreuser will be faced with a difﬁcult management problem: he will not be able to depend on our release structure. A\\nnew release of Methods affects him because he is reusing the PaymentMethod class. Most of the time, the\\nchanges will be to classes that he is not reusing, yet he must still track our new release number and probably\\nrecompile and retest his code.\\nThis can be so difﬁcult to manage that the reuser’s most likely strategy will be to make a copy of the reusable\\ncomponents and evolve that copy separately from ours. This is not reuse. The two pieces of code will become dif-\\nferent and will require independent support, effectively doubling the support burden.\\nThese problems are not exhibited by the structure in Figure 22-2. The packages in that structure are easier to\\nreuse. PayrollDomain does not drag along much baggage. It is reusable independently of any of the derivatives\\nof PaymentMethod, PaymentClassification, PaymentSchedule, etc.\\nThe astute reader will notice that the package diagram in Figure 22-2 does not completely conform to the\\nCRP. Speciﬁcally, the classes within PayrollDomain do not form the smallest reusable unit. The Transaction\\nclass does not need to be reused with the rest of the package. We could design many applications that access the\\nEmployee and its ﬁelds, but never use a Transaction.\\nThis suggests a change to the package diagram, as shown in Figure 22-3. This separates the transactions\\nfrom the elements that they manipulate. For example, the classes in the MethodTransactions package manipu-\\nlate the classes in the Methods package. We have moved the Transaction class into a new package named\\nTransactionApplication, which also contains TransactionSource and a class named Transaction-\\nApplication. These three form a reusable unit. The PayrollApplication class has now become the grand\\nuniﬁer. It contains the main program and also a derivative of TransactionApplication called\\nPayrollApplication, which ties the TextParserTransactionSource to the TransactionApplication.\\nThese manipulations have added yet another layer of abstraction to the design. The Transaction-\\nApplication package can now be reused by any application that obtains Transactions from a\\nTransactionSource and then Executes them. The PayrollApplication package is no longer reusable,\\nsince it is extremely dependent. However, the TransactionApplication package has taken its place, and is\\nmore general. Now we can reuse the PayrollDomain package without any Transactions.\\nThis certainly improves the reusability and maintainability of the project, but at the cost of ﬁve extra pack-\\nages and a more complex dependency architecture. The value of the trade-off depends on the type of reuse that we\\nmight expect and the rate at which we expect the application to evolve. If the application remains very stable, and\\nfew clients reuse it, then this change is overkill. On the other hand, if many applications will reuse this structure, or\\nwe expect the application to experience many changes, then the new structure is superior—it’s a judgment call;\\nand it should be driven by data rather then speculation. It is best to start simple and grow the package structure as\\nnecessary. Package structures can always be made more elaborate if necessary.\\nCoupling and Encapsulation\\nJust as the coupling among classes is managed by encapsulation boundaries in Java and C++, so the couplings\\namong packages can be managed by the export adornments of the UML. \\n279\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

In it, I will describe the O BSERVER1 pattern, but that is a minor objective.\\nThe primary objective of this chapter is to give you a demonstration of how your design and code can evolve to use\\na pattern.\\nIn the preceding chapters, we have made use of many patterns. Often we presented them as a fait accompli,\\nwithout showing how the code evolved to use the pattern. This might give you the idea that patterns are simply\\nsomething you insert into your code and designs in completed form. This is not what I advise. Rather, I prefer to\\nevolve the code I am working on in the direction of its needs. As I refactor it to resolve issues of coupling, simplic-\\nity, and expressiveness, I may ﬁnd that the code has come close to a particular pattern. When that happens, I\\nchange the names of the classes and variables to use the name of the pattern, and change the structure of the code\\nto use the pattern in a more regular form. Thus the code backs into the pattern.\\nThis chapter sets up a simple problem and then shows how the design and code evolve to solve that problem.\\nThe result of the evolution winds up being the OBSERVER pattern. At each stage of the evolution, I will describe the\\nissues I’m trying to resolve, and then show the steps that resolve them.\\nThe Digital Clock\\nWe have a clock object. This object catches millisecond interrupts (known as tics) from the operating system and\\nturns them into the time of day. This object knows how to calculate seconds from milliseconds, minutes from sec-\\nonds, hours from minutes, days from hours, etc. It knows how many days are in a month, and how many months are\\nin a year. It knows all about leap years, when to have them, and when not. It knows about time. (See Figure 24-1.)\\n1.

What is\\nthe simplest way to accomplish this? We could write the following code:\\npublic void DisplayTime\\n{\\n  while(1)\\n  {\\n    int sec = clock.getSeconds();\\n    int min = clock.getMinutes();\\n    int hour = clock.getHours();\\n    showTime(hour,min,sec);\\n  }\\n}\\nClearly this is suboptimal. It consumes all available CPU cycles to repeatedly display the time. Most of those\\ndisplays will be wasted because the time will not have changed. It may be that this solution would be adequate in a\\ndigital watch or a digital wall clock since conserving CPU cycles is not very important in those systems. However,\\nwe don’t want this CPU hog running on our desktop.\\nThe fundamental problem is how to efﬁciently get data from the Clock to the DigitalClock. I’m going to\\nassume that the Clock object and the DigitalClock object both exist. My interest is in how to connect them. I\\ncan test that connection simply by making sure that the data I get from the Clock are the same data I send to the\\nDigitalClock.\\nA simple way to write this test is to create one interface that pretends to be the Clock and another that pre-\\ntends to be the DigitalClock. Then I can write special test objects that implement those interfaces and verify\\nthat the connection between them works as expected.

It will then check each of the mock objects to ensure that the\\nClockDriver manages to move the time from the source to the sink. If necessary, the ClockDriverTest will\\nalso ensure that efﬁciency is being conserved.\\nI think it’s interesting that we have added interfaces to the design simply as a result of considering how to\\ntest it. In order to test a module, you have to be able to isolate it from the other modules in the system, just as we\\nhave isolated the ClockDriver from the Clock and DigitalClock. Considering tests ﬁrst helps us to minimize\\nthe coupling in our designs.\\nOK, how does the ClockDriver work? Clearly, in order to be efﬁcient, the ClockDriver must detect\\nwhen the time in the TimeSource object has changed. Then, and only then, should it move the time to the\\nTimeSink object. How can the ClockDriver know when the time has changed? It could poll the TimeSource,\\nbut that simply recreates the CPU hog problem. \\nThe simplest way for the ClockDriver to know when the time has changed is for the Clock object to tell\\nit. We could pass the ClockDriver to the Clock through the TimeSource interface and then, when the time\\nchanges, the Clock can update the ClockDriver. The ClockDriver will, in turn, set the time on the\\nClockSink. (See Figure 24-3.)\\nNotice the dependency from the TimeSource to the ClockDriver. It is there because the argument to the\\nsetDriver method is a ClockDriver. I’m not very happy with this, since it implies that TimeSource objects\\nmust use ClockDriver objects in every case. However, I’ll defer doing anything about the dependency until I get\\nthis program working.\\nListing 24-1 shows the test case for the ClockDriver. Notice that it creates a ClockDriver and binds a\\nMockTimeSource and a MockTimeSink to it. Then it sets the time in the source and expects the time to magi-\\ncally arrive at the sink.

We started with a design problem and, through reasonable evolution, wound up at the canonical\\nOBSERVER pattern. You might complain that since I knew that I wanted to arrive at the O BSERVER I simply\\narranged it so that I would. I won’t deny it. But that’s not really the issue.\\nIf you are familiar with design patterns, then when faced with a design problem, a pattern will very likely\\npop into your mind. The question then is whether or not to implement that pattern directly, or to continue to evolve\\nthe code through a series of small steps. This chapter showed what the second option is like. Rather than simply\\nleaping to the conclusion that the O BSERVER pattern was the best choice for the problem at hand, I continued to\\nresolve the issues one by one. Eventually it was pretty clear that the code was heading in the direction of\\nOBSERVER, so I changed the names and put the code into canonical form.\\nAt any point during that evolution, I could have found that my problem was solved and stopped evolving. Or,\\nI might have found that I could solve the problem by changing course and going in a different direction.\\nThe Use of Diagrams in this Chapter\\nSome of the diagrams I drew for your beneﬁt. I thought it would be easier for you to follow what I was doing by\\nshowing you an overview in a diagram. Had I not been trying to expose and expound, I would not have created\\nthem. However, a few of the diagrams were created for my beneﬁt. There were times when I just needed to stare at\\nthe structure that I had created so I could see where to go next.\\n314\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

I would not have taken the time to use a drawing tool. There are no circumstances that I know of where\\nusing a drawing tool is faster than a napkin.\\nHaving used the diagrams to help me evolve the code, I would not have kept the diagrams. In every case, the\\nones I drew for myself were intermediate steps. \\nIs there value in keeping diagrams at this level of detail? Clearly, if you are trying to expose your reasoning,\\nas I am doing in this book, they come in pretty handy. But usually we are not trying to document the evolutionary\\npath of a few hours of coding. Usually, these diagrams are transient and are better thrown away. At this level of\\ndetail, the code is generally good enough to act as its own documentation. At higher levels, that is not always true.\\nThe OBSERVER Pattern\\nOK, so now that we’ve been through the example and evolved our code to the OBSERVER pattern, it might be inter-\\nesting to study just what the OBSERVER pattern is. The canonical form of OBSERVER is shown in Figure 24-12. In\\nthis example, Clock is being observed by DigitalClock. DigitalClock registers with the Subject interface\\nof Clock. Clock calls the notify method of Subject whenever the time changes for any reason. The notify\\nmethod of Subject invokes the update method of each registered Observer. Thus, DigitalClock will receive\\nan update message whenever the time changes. It uses that opportunity to ask Clock for the time and then dis-\\nplay it.\\nOBSERVER is one of those patterns that, once you understand it, you see uses for it everywhere. The indirec-\\ntion is very cool. You can register observers with all kinds of objects rather than writing those objects to explicitly\\ncall you. While this indirection is a useful way to manage dependencies, it can easily be taken to extremes. Over-\\nuse of OBSERVER tends to make systems very difﬁcult to understand and trace.\\nPush-me-pull-u. There are two primary models of the O BSERVER pattern. Figure 24-13 shows the pull\\nmodel OBSERVER. It gets its name from the fact that the DigitalClock must pull the time information from the\\nClock object after receiving the update message. \\nThe advantage of the pull model is its simplicity of implementation and the fact that the Subject and\\nObserver classes can be standard reusable elements in a library. However, imagine that you are observing an\\nemployee record with a thousand ﬁelds and that you have just received an update message. Which of the thou-\\nsand ﬁelds changed? \\nWhen update is called on the ClockObserver, the response is obvious. The ClockObserver needs to\\npull the time from the Clock and display it. But when update is called on the EmployeeObserver, the response\\nis not so obvious. We don’t know what happened. We don’t know what to do. Perhaps the employee’s name\\nchanged, or maybe it was his salary. Maybe he got a new boss. Or maybe his bank account changed. We need help.\\nThis help can be given in the push-model form of the O BSERVER pattern. The structure of the push-model\\nobserver is shown in Figure 24-13. Notice that the notify and update methods both take an argument. The argu-\\nment is a hint, passed from Employee to SalaryObserver through the notify and update methods. That hint\\ntells SalaryObserver the kind of change the Employee record experienced.\\nFigure 24-12 Canonical Pull-Model OBSERVER\\nSubject\\n+ register(Observer)\\n# notify()\\nObserver\\n«interface»\\n+ update()\\n0..*\\nDigitalClockClock\\n315\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

If the observed object is complex, and the observer needs a hint, then the push model is appropriate. If the\\nobserved object is simple, then a pull model will do ﬁne.\\nHow OBSERVER Manages the Principles of OOD\\nThe principle that most drives the O BSERVER pattern is the Open–Closed Principle (OCP). The motivation\\nfor using the pattern is so that you can add new observing objects without changing the observed object. Thus the\\nobserved object stays closed. \\nLooking back on Figure 24-12, it should be clear that Clock is substitutable for Subject and that\\nDigitalClock is substitutable for Observer. Thus, the Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) is applied. \\nObserver is an abstract class, and the concrete DigitialClock depends upon it. The concrete methods of\\nSubject also depend upon it. Hence, the Dependency-Inversion Principle (DIP) is applied in this case. You might\\nthink that since Subject has no abstract methods, the dependency between Clock and Subject violates the DIP.\\nHowever, Subject is a class that ought never to be instantiated. It only makes sense in the context of a derived\\nclass. Thus, Subject is logically abstract, even though it has no abstract methods. We can enforce the abstractness\\nof Subject by giving it a pure virtual destructor in C++ or by making its constructors protected. \\nThere are hints of the Interface-Segregation Principle (ISP) in Figure 24-11.

The violation of the DIP is easy to see, the dependency from Switch to\\nLight is a dependency upon a concrete class. DIP tells us to prefer dependencies on abstract classes. The violation\\nof OCP is a little less direct, but is more to the point. We don’t like this design because it forces us to drag a Light\\nalong everywhere we need a Switch. Switch cannot be easily extended to control objects other than Light. \\nABSTRACT SERVER\\nYou might be thinking that you could inherit a subclass from Switch that would control something other than a\\nlight as in Figure 25-3. But this doesn’t solve the problem because FanSwitch still inherits the dependency upon\\nLight. Wherever you take a FanSwitch, you’ll have to bring Light along. In any case, that particular inherit-\\nance relationship also violates the DIP.\\nTo solve the problem, we invoke one of the simplest of all design patterns: A BSTRACT SERVER. (See Figure\\n25-2.) By introducing an interface between the Switch and the Light, we have made it possible for Switch to\\ncontrol anything that implements that interface. This immediately satisﬁes both the DIP and the OCP. \\nWho Owns the Interface?\\nAs an interesting aside, notice that the interface is named for its client. It is called Switchable rather than\\nILight. We’ve talked about this before, and we’ll probably notice it again. Interfaces belong to the client, not to\\nthe derivative.

But over the last decade, we have learned that the physi-\\ncal strength of inheritance is misleading and that inheritance hierarchies should usually not be packaged together.\\nRather, clients tend to be packaged with the interfaces they control.\\nThis misalignment of the strength of logical and physical bonds is an artifact of statically typed languages\\nlike C++ and Java. Dynamically typed languages, like Smalltalk, Python, and Ruby, don’t have the misalignment\\nbecause they don’t use inheritance to achieve polymorphic behavior. \\nAdapter\\nThere is a problem with the design in Figure 25-3. There is a potential violation of the Single-Responsibility Prin-\\nciple (SRP). We have bound together two things, Light and Switchable, that may not change for the same rea-\\nsons. What if we can’t add the inheritance relationship to Light? What if we purchased Light from a third party\\nand we don’t have the source code. Or what if there is some other class that we want a Switch to control but that\\nwe can’t derive from Switchable? Enter the ADAPTER.1\\nFigure 25-4 shows how the Adapter pattern can be employed to solve the problem. The adapter derives\\nfrom Switchable and delegates to Light. This solves the problem neatly. Now we can have any object that can\\nbe turned on or off controlled by a Switch. All we need to do is create the appropriate adapter. Indeed, the object\\nneed not even have the same turnOn and turnOff methods that Switchable has. The adapter can be adapted to\\nthe interface of the object.\\nTANSTAAFL.  Adapters don’t come cheap. You need to write the new class, and you need to instantiate\\nthe adapter and bind the adapted object to it. Then, every time you invoke the adapter, you have to pay for the time\\nand space required for the delegation. So clearly, you don’t want to use adapters all the time. The A BSTRACT\\nSERVER solution is quite appropriate for most situations. In fact, even the initial solution in Figure 25-1 is pretty\\ngood unless you happen to know that there are other objects for Switch to control.\\nThe Class Form of ADAPTER\\nThe LightAdapter class in Figure 25-4 is known as an object form adapter. There is another approach known as\\nthe class form adapter,  which is shown in Figure 25-5. In this form, the adapter object inherits from both the\\nSwitchable interface and the Light class. This form is a tiny bit more efﬁcient than the object form and is a bit\\neasier to use, but at the expense of using the high coupling of inheritance. \\n1.

We have a large number of modem clients all making use of the Modem inter-\\nface. The Modem interface is implemented by several derivatives, including HayesModem, USRoboticsModem,\\nand EarniesModem. This is a pretty common situation. It conforms nicely to the OCP, LSP, and DIP. Modem cli-\\nents are unaffected when there are new kinds of modems to deal with. Suppose this situation were to continue for\\nseveral years. Suppose that there were hundreds of modem clients all making happy use of the Modem interface. \\nNow suppose that our customers have given us a new requirement. There are certain kinds of modems that\\ndon’t dial. These are called dedicated modems because they sit at both ends of a dedicated connection.2 There are\\nseveral new applications that use these dedicated modems and don’t bother to dial. We’ll call these the DedUsers.\\nHowever, our customers want all the current modem clients to be able to use these dedicated modems. They tell us\\nthat they don’t want to have to modify the hundreds of modem client applications, so those modem clients will\\nsimply be told to dial dummy phone numbers. \\nIf we had our druthers, we might want to alter the design of our system as shown in Figure 25-7. We’d make\\nuse of the ISP to split the dialling and communications functions into two separate interfaces. The old modems\\nwould implement both interfaces, and the modem clients would use both interfaces. The DedUsers would use\\nnothing but the Modem interface, and the DedicatedModem would implement just the Modem interface. Unfortu-\\nnately this requires us to make changes to all the modem clients—something that our customers forbade. \\nSo what do we do? We can’t separate the interfaces as we’d like, yet we must provide a way for all the\\nmodem clients to use DedicatedModem. One possible solution is to derive DedicatedModem from Modem and to\\nimplement the dial and hangup functions to do nothing, as follows:\\nFigure 25-5 Solving the Table Lamp with ADAPTER\\nFigure 25-6 Modem Problem\\n2.

The users of the base class may be expect-\\ning dial and hangup to signiﬁcantly change the state of the modem. The degenerate implementations in\\nDedicatedModem may violate those expectations. \\nLet’s presume that the modem clients were written to expect their modems to be dormant until dial is\\ncalled and to return to dormancy when hangup is called. In other words, they don’t expect any characters to be\\ncoming out of modems that aren’t dialled. DedicatedModem violates this expectation. It will return characters\\nbefore dial has been called, and it will continue to return them after hangup has been called. Thus, Dedicated-\\nModem may crash some of the modem clients.\\nNow you might suggest that the problem is with the modem clients. They aren’t written very well if they\\ncrash on unexpected input. I’d agree with that. But it’s going to be hard to convince the folks who have to maintain\\nthe modem clients to make changes to their software because we are adding a new kind of modem. Not only does\\nthis violate the OCP, it’s also just plain frustrating. And besides, our customer has explicitly forbidden us from\\nchanging the modem clients.\\nWe Can Fix this with a Kludge.  We can simulate a connection status in the dial and hangup methods\\nof DedicatedModem. We can refuse to return characters if dial has not been called, or after hangup has been\\ncalled. If we make this change, then all the modem clients will be happy and won’t have to change. All we have to\\ndo is convince the DedUsers to call dial and hangup. (See Figure 25-8.)\\nYou might imagine that the folks who are building the DedUsers ﬁnd this pretty frustrating. They are explic-\\nitly using DedicatedModem. Why should they have to call dial and hangup? However, they haven’t written\\ntheir software yet, so it’s easier to get them to do what we want.\\nA Tangled Web of Dependencies.

That’s why they got away with the char[10] in dial. Now, however, our customers want us to be able\\nto dial phone numbers of arbitrary length.

They were written to expect char[10] for the phone num-\\nber. Our customers authorize this because they have no choice, and hordes of programmers are put to the task. Just\\nas clearly, the classes in the modem hierarchy must change to accommodate the new phone number size. Our little\\nteam can deal with that. Unfortunately, we now have to go to the authors of the DedUsers and tell them that they\\nhave to change their code! You might imagine how happy they’ll be about that. They aren’t calling dial because\\nthey need to. They are calling dial because we told them they have to. And now they are going through an expen-\\nsive maintenance job because they did what we told them to do.\\nThis is the kind of nasty dependency tangle that many projects ﬁnd themselves in. A kludge in one part of the\\nsystem creates a nasty thread of dependency that eventually causes problems in what ought to be a completely\\nunrelated part of the system.\\nADAPTER to the Rescue. We could have prevented this ﬁasco by using an A DAPTER to solve the initial\\nproblem as shown in Figure 25-9. In this case, DedicatedModem does not inherit from Modem. The modem clients\\nuse DedicatedModem indirectly through the DedicatedModemAdapter. This adapter implements dial and\\nhangup to simulate the connection state. It delegates send and recieve calls to the DedicatedModem. \\nNote that this eliminates all the difﬁculties we had before. Modem clients are seeing the connection behavior\\nthat they expect, and DedUsers don’t have to ﬁddle with dial or hangup. When the phone number requirement\\nchanges, the DedUsers will be unaffected. Thus, we have ﬁxed both the LSP and OCP violations by putting the\\nadapter in place. \\nNote that the kludge still exists. The adapter is still simulating connection state. You may think this is ugly,\\nand I’d certainly agree with you. However, notice that all the dependencies point away from the adapter. The\\nkludge is isolated from the system, tucked away in an adapter that barely anybody knows about. The only hard\\ndependency upon that adapter will likely be in the implementation of some factory somewhere.3\\nBRIDGE\\nThere is another way to look at this problem.

Each object that is to be proxied is split into\\nthree parts. The ﬁrst is an interface that declares all the methods that clients need to invoke. The second is a class\\nthat implements those methods without knowledge of the database. The third is the proxy that knows about the\\ndatabase. \\nConsider the Product class. We have proxied it by replacing it with an interface. This interface has all the\\nsame methods that Product has. The ProductImplementation class implements the interface almost exactly\\nas before. The ProductDBProxy implements all the methods of Product to fetch the product from the database,\\ncreate an instance of ProductImplementation, and then delegate the message to it.\\nThe sequence diagram in Figure 26-4 shows how this works. The client sends the getPrice message to\\nwhat it thinks is a Product, but what is really a ProductDBProxy. The ProductDBProxy fetches the Product-\\nImplementation from the database. It then delegates the getPrice method to it.\\nNeither the client nor the ProductImplementation knows that this has happened. The database has been\\ninserted into the application without either party knowing about it. That’s the beauty of the P ROXY pattern. In\\ntheory, it can be inserted in between two collaborating objects without those objects having to know about it. Thus,\\nit can be used to cross a barrier like a database or a network without either of the participants knowing about it.\\nIn reality, using proxies is nontrivial. To get an idea what some of the problems are, let’s try to add the\\nPROXY pattern to the simple shopping cart application.\\nFigure 26-3 PROXY static model\\nFigure 26-4 PROXY dynamic model\\nProduct\\nDB ProxyDB\\nProduct\\n«interface»\\n«delegates» Product\\nImplementation\\nProduct\\nDB Proxy\\nProduct\\nImplementation\\nDB\\ngetPrice() retrieveProduct(sku)\\nprice\\nProduct\\nprice\\ngetPrice()\\n331\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

My intent was to implement the PROXY pattern.\\nBut when the implementation ﬁnally materialized, the canonical pattern made no sense. \\nAs shown below, the canonical pattern would have had ProductProxy create a ProductImp in every\\nmethod. It would then have delegated that method to the ProductImp. \\npublic int getPrice() throws Exception\\n{\\n  ProductData pd = DB.getProductData(itsSku);\\n  ProductImp p = new ProductImp(pd.sku, pd.name, pd.price);\\n  return p.getPrice();\\n}\\nThe creation of the ProductImp is a complete waste of programmer and computer resources. The\\nProductProxy already has the data that the ProductImp accessors would return. So there is no need to create,\\nand then delegate to, the ProductImp. This is yet another example of how the code may lead you away from the\\npatterns and models you expected.\\nNotice that the getSku method of ProductProxy in Listing 26-13 takes this theme one step further. It\\ndoesn’t even bother to hit the database for the sku. Why should it? It already has the sku.\\nYou might be thinking that the implementation of ProductProxy is very inefﬁcient. It hits the database for\\neach accessor. Wouldn’t it be better if it cached the ProductData item in order to avoid hitting the database?\\nThis change is trivial, but the only thing driving us to do it is our fear. At this point, we have no data to sug-\\ngest that this program has a performance problem. And besides, we know that the database engine is doing some\\ncaching too. So it’s not clear what building our own cache would buy us. We should wait until we see indications\\nof a performance problem before we invent trouble for ourselves.\\n337\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

Our next step is to create the proxy for Order. Each Order instance contains\\nmany Item instances. In the relational schema (Figure 26-2), this relationship is captured within the Item table.\\nEach row of the Item table contains the key of the Order that contains it. In the object model, however, the rela-\\ntionship is implemented by a Vector within Order. (See Listing 26-4.) Somehow the proxy is going to have to\\ntranslate between the two forms. \\nWe begin by posing a test case that the proxy must pass. This test adds a few dummy products to the data-\\nbase. It then obtains proxies to those products, and uses them to invoke addItem on an OrderProxy. Finally, it\\nasks the OrderProxy for the total price. (See Listing 26-14.)

The ﬁrst we’ll\\ntackle is the newOrder method of DB. It looks like this method returns an instance of something called an\\nOrderData. OrderData is just like ProductData.

Notice that when we call it in Listing 26-14, we pro-\\nvide the ID of the owning customer, but we do not provide the orderId. Each Order needs an orderId to act as\\nits key. What’s more, in the relational schema, each Item refers to this orderId as a way to show its connection to\\nthe Order. Clearly the orderId must be unique. How does it get created?

I’m\\ngetting frustrated with all these exceptions. The implementations of proxies behind an interface should not have an\\neffect on that interface, and yet the proxies are throwing exceptions that propagate out through the interface. So I\\nresolve to change all the Exceptions to Errors so that I don’t have to pollute the interfaces with throws clauses\\nand the users of those interfaces with try/catch blocks.\\nHow do I implement addItem in the proxy? Clearly the proxy cannot delegate to OrderImp.addItem!\\nRather, the proxy is going to have to insert an Item row in the database. On the other hand, I  really want to dele-\\ngate OrderProxy.total to OrderImp.total, because I want the business rules (i.e., the policy for creating\\ntotals) to be encapsulated in OrderImp. The whole point of building proxies is to separate database implementa-\\ntion from business rules. \\nIn order to delegate the total function, the proxy is going to have to build the complete Order object along\\nwith all its contained Items. Thus, in OrderProxy.total, we are going to have to read in all the items from the\\ndatabase, call addItem on an empty OrderImp for each item we ﬁnd, and then call total on that OrderImp.\\nThus, the OrderProxy implementation ought to look something like Listing 26-20.\\nListing 26-20\\nOrderProxy.java\\nimport java.sql.SQLException;\\npublic class OrderProxy implements Order\\n{\\n  private int orderId;\\n  public OrderProxy(int orderId)\\n  {\\n    this.orderId = orderId;\\n  }\\n  public int total()\\n  {\\n    try\\n    {\\n      OrderImp imp = new OrderImp(getCustomerId());\\n      ItemData[] itemDataArray = DB.getItemsForOrder(orderId);\\n      for (int i = 0; i < itemDataArray.length; i++)\\n      {\\n        ItemData item = itemDataArray[i];\\n        imp.addItem(new ProductProxy(item.sku), item.qty);\\n      }\\n      return imp.total();\\n    }\\n    catch (Exception e)\\n    {\\n      throw new Error(e.toString());\\n    }\\n  }\\n341\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

Indeed, I have found that adding caching too early is a very good way to\\ndecrease performance. If you fear performance may be a problem, I recommend that you conduct some experi-\\nments to prove that it will be a problem. Once proven, and only once proven, you should start considering how to\\nspeed things up.\\nThe Beneﬁt of PROXY. For all the troublesome nature of proxies, they have one very powerful beneﬁt:\\nthe separation of concerns . In our example, the business rules and the database have been completely separated.\\nOrderImp has no dependence whatever on the database. If we want to change the database schema or change the\\ndatabase engine, we can do so without affecting Order, OrderImp, or any of the other business domain classes.\\nIn those instances where separation of business rules from database implementation is critically important,\\nPROXY can be a good pattern to employ. For that matter, P ROXY can be used to separate business rules from any\\nkind of implementation issue. It can be used to keep the business rules from being polluted by such things as\\nCOM, CORBA, EJB, etc. It is a way to keep the business rule assets of your project separate from the implemen-\\ntation mechanisms that are currently in vogue.\\nDealing with Databases, Middleware, and Other Third Party Interfaces\\nThird party APIs are a fact of life for software engineers. We buy database engines, middleware engines, class\\nlibraries, threading libraries, etc. Initially, we use these APIs by making direct calls to them from our application\\ncode. (See Figure 26-5.)\\nOver time, however, we ﬁnd that our application code becomes more and more polluted with such API calls.\\nIn a database application, for example, we may ﬁnd more and more SQL strings littering the code that also con-\\ntains the business rules.\\nThis becomes a problem when the third party API changes. For databases it also becomes a problem when\\nthe schema changes. As new versions of the API or schema are released, more and more of the application code\\nhas to be reworked to align with those changes.\\nEventually, the developers decide that they must insulate themselves from these changes. So they invent a\\nlayer that separates the application business rules from the third party API. (See Figure 26-6.) They concentrate\\ninto this layer all the code that uses the third party API and all of the concepts that are related to the API rather than\\nto the business rules of the application. \\nSuch layers can sometimes be purchased. ODBC or JDBC are such layers. They separate the application\\ncode from the actual database engine. Of course, they are also third party APIs in and of themselves; therefore, the\\napplication may need to be insulated even from them. \\nNotice that there is a transitive dependency from the Application to the API. In some applications, that\\nindirect dependence is still enough to cause problems. JDBC, for example, does not insulate the application from\\nthe details of the schema.\\nIn order to attain even better insulation, we need to invert the dependency between the application and the\\nlayer. (See Figure 26-7.) This keeps the application from knowing anything at all about the third party API, either\\ndirectly or indirectly. In the case of a database, it keeps the application from direct knowledge of the schema.

Whenever the API changes, the\\nproxies change. Whenever the application changes, the proxies change. The proxies can become very hard to\\ndeal with.\\nIt’s good to know where your nightmares live. Without the proxies, the nightmares would be spread through-\\nout the application code. \\nMost applications don’t need proxies. Proxies are a very heavyweight solution. When I see proxy solutions\\nin use, my recommendation in most cases is to take them out and use something simpler. But there are cases when\\nthe intense separation between the application and the API afforded by proxies is beneﬁcial. Those cases are\\nalmost always in very large systems that undergo frequent schema or API thrashing. Or they are in systems that\\ncan ride on top of many different database engines or middleware engines.\\nSTAIRWAY TO HEAVEN1\\nSTAIRWAY TO HEAVEN is another pattern that achieves the same dependency inversion as P ROXY. It employs a\\nvariation on the class form of the ADAPTER pattern. (See Figure 26-9.)\\nPersistentObject is an abstract class that knows about the database. It provides two abstract methods:\\nread and write. It also provides a set of implemented methods that provides the tools needed to implement read\\nand write. PersistentProduct, for example, uses these tools to implement read and write to read and write\\nall the data ﬁelds of Product from and to the database. By the same token, PersistentAssembly implements\\nread and write to do the same for the extra ﬁelds within Assembly. It inherits the ability to read and write the\\nﬁelds of Product from PersistentProduct and structures the read and write methods so as to take advan-\\ntage of that fact.\\nThis pattern is only useful in languages that support multiple inheritance. Note that both PersistentProduct\\nand PersistentAssembly inherit from two implemented base classes. What’s more, PersistentAssembly ﬁnds\\nitself in a diamond inheritance relationship with Product. In C++, we use virtual inheritance to prevent two instances\\nof Product from being inherited into PersistentAssembly. \\nThe need for virtual inheritance, or similar relationships in other languages, means that this pattern is some-\\nwhat intrusive. It makes itself felt in the Product hierarchy, but the intrusion is minimal. \\nThe beneﬁt of this pattern is that it completely separates knowledge of the database away from the business\\nrules of the application. Those small bits of the application that need to invoke read and write can do so through\\nthe following exigency:\\n1.

The ﬁrst test-case veriﬁes that a PersistentProduct can be passed around the system as a Product\\nand then converted to a PersistentObject and written at will. We assume that the PersistentProduct will\\nwrite itself in a simple XML format. The second test case veriﬁes the same for PersistentAssembly, the only\\ndifference being the addition of a second ﬁeld in the Assembly object.\\nListing 26-24\\nproductPersistenceTestCase.cpp {abridged}\\nvoid ProductPersistenceTestCase::testWriteProduct()\\n{\\n  ostrstream s;\\n  Product* p = new PersistentProduct(\"Cheerios\");\\n  PersistentObject* po = dynamic_cast<PersistentObject*>(p);\\n  assert(po);\\n  po->write(s);\\n  char* writtenString = s.str();\\n  assert(strcmp(\"<PRODUCT><NAME>Cheerios</NAME></PRODUCT>\",\\n                writtenString) == 0);\\n}\\nvoid ProductPersistenceTestCase::testWriteAssembly()\\n{\\n  ostrstream s;\\n  Assembly* a = new PersistentAssembly(\"Wheaties\", \"7734\");\\n  PersistentObject* po = dynamic_cast<PersistentObject*>(a);\\n  assert(po);\\n  po->write(s);\\n  char* writtenString = s.str();\\n  assert(strcmp(\"<ASSEMBLY><NAME>Wheaties\"\\n                \"</NAME><ASSYCODE>7734</ASSYCODE></ASSEMBLY>\",\\n                 writtenString) == 0);\\n}\\nNext, in Listings 26-25 through 26-28, we see the deﬁnitions and implementations of both Product and\\nAssembly.

Imagine a visitor hierarchy that knows how to write the visited object on a database. You would\\nwrite an object on the database by creating the appropriate type of visitor, and then calling accept on the object to\\nbe written.\\n5. See “Extension Object” on page 408\\n6.

There are two ways to use a decorator to implement databases. You can decorate a business\\nobject and give it read and write methods; or you can decorate a data object that knows how to read and write\\nitself and give it business rules. The latter approach is not uncommon when using object-oriented databases. The\\nbusiness rules are kept out of the OODB schema and added in with decorators.\\nFacade. This is my favorite starting point. It’s simple and effective. On the down side, it couples the busi-\\nness-rule objects with the database. Figure 26-10 shows the structure. The DatabaseFacade class simply pro-\\nvides methods for reading and writing all the necessary objects. This couples the objects with the\\nDatabaseFacade and vice versa. The objects know about the facade because they are often the ones that call the\\nread and write functions. The facade knows about the objects because it must use their accessors and mutators\\nto implement the read and write functions.\\nThis coupling can cause a lot of problems in larger applications; but in smaller apps or in apps that are just\\nstarting to grow, it’s a pretty effective technique. If you start using a facade and then later decide to change to one\\nof the other patterns to reduce coupling, the facade is pretty easy to refactor.\\nConclusion\\nIt is very tempting to anticipate the need for P ROXY or STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN long before the need really exists.\\nThis is almost never a good idea, especially with PROXY.

A competitor named Microburst, Inc., has recently announced a product line that starts at\\nthe low end and can be incrementally upgraded to higher reliability. This threatens to cut the Cloud Company off\\nfrom smaller but growing customers. These customers will already be using Microburst products by the time they\\ngrow to a size that would allow them to use Cloud Company products.\\nMore frightening still, the Microburst product boasts the ability to be interconnected at the high end. That is,\\nthe high-end upgrades can be networked together into a wide-area weather monitoring system. This threatens to\\nerode the current Cloud Company customer base.\\nThe Strategy. Although Microburst has successfully demonstrated its low-end units at trade shows, they\\nare not offering production quantity shipments for at least six months. This indicates that there may be engineering\\nor production problems that Microburst has not solved. Moreover, the high-reliability upgrades promised by\\nMicroburst as part of the product line are currently not available. It seems that Microburst has announced the prod-\\nuct prematurely.\\nIf the Cloud Company can announce a low-end upgradable and connectable product, and begin shipping it\\nwithin six months, then they may be able to capture, or at least stall, customers who would otherwise buy\\nMicroburst’s products. By stalling the market and thereby depriving Microburst of orders, they might be able to\\ncompromise Microburst’s ability to solve their engineering and manufacturing problems, a very desirable\\noutcome.\\nThe Dilemma. A new low-cost and extendable product line requires a signiﬁcant amount of engineering.\\nThe hardware engineers have ﬂatly refused to commit to a six-month development deadline. They believe that it\\nwill be twelve months before they could see production-quantity units. \\nThe marketing managers believe that in twelve months, Microburst will be shipping production quantity and\\nwill be capturing an irretrievable part of Cloud Company’s customers.\\nThe Plan. Cloud Company managers have decided to announce their new product line immediately and\\nto begin accepting orders that will be shipped before six months have elapsed. They have named the new product\\nNimbus-LC 1.0. Their plan is to repackage the old, expensive, high-reliability hardware into a new enclosure with\\na nice LCD touch panel. The high manufacturing cost of these units means that the company will actually lose\\nmoney on each one that they sell.\\nConcurrently, the hardware engineers will begin to develop the true low-cost hardware, which will be avail-\\nable in 12 months. This conﬁguration of the product has been called Nimbus-LC 2.0. When production quantities\\nare available, the Nimbus-LC 1.0 will be phased out. \\nWhen a Nimbus-LC 1.0 customer wants to upgrade to a higher level of service, his unit will be replaced with\\na Nimbus-LC 2.0 at no additional cost. Thus, the company is willing to lose money on this product for six months\\nin order to capture, or at least stall, potential Microburst customers.\\nThe WMS-LC Software\\nThe software project for the Nimbus-LC project is complex. The developers must create a software product that\\ncan use both the existing hardware as well as the low-cost 2.0 hardware. Prototype units of the 2.0 hardware will\\nnot be available for nine months. Moreover, the processor on the 2.0 board is not likely to be the same as the pro-\\ncessor on the 1.0 board. Still, the system must operate identically, regardless of which hardware platform it uses.\\nThe hardware engineers will be writing the lowest-level hardware drivers, and they need the application soft-\\nware engineers to design the API for these drivers. This API must be available to the hardware engineers within the\\nnext four months. The software must be production ready in 6 months and must be working with the 2.0 hardware\\nin 12 months. They want at least 6 weeks of Q/A for the 1.0 device, so the software engineers really have only 20\\nweeks to get the software working. Since the hardware platform for the 2.0 version is new, they need 8 to 10 weeks\\nof Q/A. This eats up most of the 3-month period between ﬁrst prototype and ﬁnal shipment. Thus the software\\nengineers will have very little time to make the new hardware work.\\n356\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

This plan tries to address the major risks early in \\nthe project life cycle, while assuring that the software will be complete by the necessary deadlines.\\nLanguage Selection\\nThe most important constraint upon the language is portability. The short development time, and the even shorter\\ncontact that the software engineers will have with the 2.0 hardware demand that both the 1.0 and 2.0 versions use\\nthe same software. That is, the source code needs to be identical, or nearly so. If the portability constraint cannot\\nbe met by the language, the release of the 2.0 version at the 12-month mark will be in severe jeopardy.\\nFortunately, there are few other constraints. The software is not very large, so space is not much of a prob-\\nlem. There are no hard real-time deadlines that are shorter than one second, so speed is not much of an issue.\\nIndeed, the real-time deadlines are so weak that a moderately fast garbage-collecting language would not be inap-\\npropriate. The portability constraints, and the lack of any other serious constraints, make the selection of Java quite\\nappropriate.\\nNimbus-LC Software Design\\nAccording to the release plan, one of the major goals of phase I is to create an architecture that will allow the bulk\\nof the software to be independent of the hardware that it controls. Indeed, we want to separate the abstract behavior\\nof the weather station from its concrete implementation.\\nFor example, the software must be able to display the current temperature regardless of the hardware conﬁg-\\nuration. This implies the design shown in Figure 27-1.\\nAn abstract base class named TemperatureSensor supplies a polymorphic read() function. Derivatives\\nof this base class allow for separate implementations of the read() function.\\nThe Test Classes. Notice that there is one derivative for each of the two known hardware platforms. There\\nis also a special derivative named TestTemperatureSensor. This class will be used to test the software in a\\n1.

The Nimbus 2.0\\nversion will be at risk because of this short time frame.

The most common mode of the Nimbus system is when it is display-\\ning current weather-monitoring data. Each of the values are updated at their own particular rate.

Clearly, we need some\\nkind of scheduler that will trigger these readings and communicate them to the user. Figure 27-2 shows a\\npossible structure.\\nWe imagine the Scheduler to be a base class that has many possible implementations, one for each of the\\nhardware and test platforms. The Scheduler has a tic function that it expects will be called once every 10 ms. It\\nis the responsibility of the derived class to make this call. (See Figure 27-3.) The Scheduler counts the tic()\\ncalls. Once per minute, it calls the read() function of the TemperatureSensor and passes the returned temper-\\nature to the MonitoringScreen.

The requirements document says that we must report the trend of the baro-\\nmetric pressure. This is a value that can have three states: rising, falling, or stable. How do we determine the value\\nof this variable?\\nAccording to the Federal Meteorological Handbook,2 the barometric-pressure trend is calculated as follows:\\nIf the pressure is rising or falling at a rate of at least 0.06 inch per hour and the pressure change totals\\n0.02 inch or more at the time of the observation [to be taken once every three hours], a pressure\\nchange remark shall be reported.\\nWhere do we put this algorithm? If we put it in the BarometricPressureSensor class, then that class\\nwill need to know the time of each reading, and it will have to keep track of a series of readings going back three\\nhours. Our current design does not allow for this. We could ﬁx this by adding the current time as an argument to\\nthe Read function of the BarometricPressureSensor class and guaranteeing that that function will be called\\non a regular basis. \\nHowever, this couples the trend calculation to the frequency of user updates. It is not inconceivable that a\\nchange to the user interface update scheme could affect the pressure-trend algorithm. Also, it is very unfriendly for\\na sensor to demand that it be read on a regular basis in order to function properly. A better solution needs to be\\nfound.\\nWe could have the Scheduler keep track of barometric pressure history and calculate trends at need. How-\\never, will we then also put temperature and wind speed history in the Scheduler class? Every new kind of sensor\\nor history requirement would cause us to change the Scheduler class. This has the makings of a maintenance\\nnightmare.\\nReconsidering the Scheduler. Take another look at Figure 27-2. Notice that the Scheduler is con-\\nnected to each of the sensors and to the user interface. As more sensors are added, and as more user interface\\nscreens are added, they will have to be added to the Scheduler too. Thus, the Scheduler is not closed to the\\naddition of new sensors or user interfaces. This is a violation of the OCP. We would like to design the Scheduler\\nso that it is independent of changes and additions to the sensors and user interfaces.\\nDecoupling the User Interface. User interfaces are volatile. They are subject to the whims of customers,\\nmarketing people, and nearly everyone else who comes in contact with the product. It seems very likely that if any\\npart of the system suffers requirements thrashing, it will be the user interface. Therefore, we should decouple\\nit ﬁrst.\\nFigures 27-4 and 27-5 show a new design that uses the OBSERVER pattern. We have made the UI a dependent\\nof the sensor, so that when the sensor reading changes, the UI will be automatically notiﬁed. Notice that the depen-\\n2.

The actual observer is an ADAPTER3 named TemperatureObserver. This object is notiﬁed by\\nthe TemperatureSensor when the temperature reading changes. In response, the TemperatureObsever calls\\nthe DisplayTemp function of the MonitoringScreen object.\\nThis design has nicely decoupled the UI from the Scheduler. The Scheduler now knows nothing of the\\nUI and can focus solely upon telling the sensors when to read. The UI binds itself to the sensors and expects them\\nto report any changes. However, the UI does not know about the sensors themselves. It simply knows about a set of\\nobjects that implements the Observable interface. This will allow us to add sensors without making signiﬁcant\\nchanges to this part of the UI.\\nWe have also solved the problem of the barometric-pressure trend. This reading can now be calculated by\\na separate BarometricPressureTrendSensor that observes the BarometricPressureSensor. (See Figure 27-6.)\\nRethinking the Scheduler—Yet Again. The major role of the Scheduler is to tell each of the sensors\\nwhen they should acquire a new value. However, if future requirements force us to add or remove a sensor, the\\nScheduler will need to be changed. Indeed, the Scheduler will have to change, even if we simply want to\\nchange the rate of a sensor. This is an unfortunate violation of the OCP. It seems that the knowledge of a sensor’s\\npolling rate belongs to the sensor itself and not any other part of the system. \\nWe can decouple the Scheduler from the sensors by using the Listener4 paradigm from the Java class\\nlibrary. This is similar to OBSERVER in that you register to be notiﬁed of something; but in this case, we want to be\\nnotiﬁed when a certain event (time) occurs. (See Figure 27-7.)\\nSensors create anonymous A DAPTER classes that implement the AlarmListener interface. The sensors\\nthen register those adapters with the AlarmClock (the class we used to call the Scheduler). As part of the regis-\\ntration, they tell the AlarmClock how often they would like to be woken up (e.g., every second or every ﬁfty mil-\\nliseconds). When that period expires, the AlarmClock sends the wakeup message to the adapter, which then\\nsends the read message to the sensor.\\nThis has completely changed the nature of the Scheduler class. In Figure 27-2 it formed the center of our\\nsystem and knew about most of the other components. But now it simply sits at the side of the system. It knows\\n3.

It conforms to the SRP by doing one job—scheduling—which has nothing\\nwhatever to do with weather monitoring. Indeed, it could be reused in many different kinds of applications. In fact,\\nthe change is so dramatic that we have changed the name to AlarmClock.\\nThe Structure of the Sensors. Having decoupled the sensors from the rest of the system, we should look\\nat their internal structure. Sensors now have three separate functions. First, they have to create and register the\\nanonymous derivative of the AlarmListener. Second, they have to determine if their readings have changed and\\ninvoke the notifyObservers method of the Observable class. Third, they have to interact with the Nimbus\\nhardware in order to read the appropriate values.\\nFigure 27-1 showed how these concerns might be separated. Figure 27-8 integrates that design with the other\\nchanges we have made. The TemperatureSensor base class deals with the ﬁrst two concerns, since they are\\ngeneric. The derivative of TemperatureSensor can then deal with the hardware and perform the actual readings. \\nFigure 27-8 employs TEMPLATE METHOD in order to achieve the separation between the generic and speciﬁc\\nconcerns of the TemperatureSensor. You can see this pattern in the private check and read functions of\\nTemperatureSensor. When the AlarmClock calls wakeup on the anonymous class, the anonymous class for-\\nwards the call to the check function of the TemperatureSensor. The check function then calls the abstract\\nread function of TemperatureSensor. This function will be implemented by the derivative to properly interact\\nwith the hardware and obtain the sensor reading. The check function then determines whether the new reading is\\ndifferent from the previous reading. If a difference is detected, then it notiﬁes the waiting observers.\\nFigure 27-6 Barometric Pressure Observers\\nFigure 27-7 Decoupled Alarm clock\\nBarometric\\nPressure Trend\\nSensor\\nBarometric\\nPressure\\nSensor\\nBarometric\\nPressure Trend\\nObserver\\nScheduler\\nMonitoring Screen\\n- tic()\\n+ update()\\nBarometric\\nPressure\\nObserver\\n+ update()\\nObservable\\n+ addObserver()\\n+ notifyObservers()\\n+ displayTemp(double)\\n+ displayPressure(double)\\n+ displayPressureTrend(double)\\nObserver\\n*\\n«creates»\\n«creates»\\nTemperature\\nSensor\\n«anonymous»\\nAlarmListener\\n«interface»\\n+ wakeEvery(interval, AlarmListener)\\n+ wakeup()\\nAlarmClock\\n*\\n361\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

For every new hardware or testing plat-\\nform, we will be able to create a derivative of TemperatureSensor that will work with it. Moreover, that deriva-\\ntive must merely override one very simple function: read(). The rest of the functionality of the sensor remains in\\nthe base class where it belongs.\\nWhere Is the API? One of our Release II goals is the creation of a new API for the Nimbus 2.0 hardware.\\nThis API should be written in Java, be extensible, and provide simple and direct access to the Nimbus 2.0 hard-\\nware. Furthermore, it must serve the Nimbus 1.0 hardware as well. Without that API, all the simple debugging and\\ncalibration tools that we write for this project will have to be changed when the new board is introduced. Where is\\nthis API within our current design?\\nIt turns out that nothing we have created so far can serve as a simple API. What we are looking for is some-\\nthing like this:\\npublic interface TemperatureSensor\\n{\\n  public double read();\\n}\\nWe are going to want to write tools that have direct access to this API without having to bother with register-\\ning observers. We also don’t want sensors at this level to be polling themselves automatically, or interacting with\\nthe AlarmClock. We want something very simple and isolated that acts as the direct interface to the hardware.\\nIt may seem that we are reversing all our previous arguments. After all, Figure 27-1 shows exactly what we\\nhave just asked for. However, the changes we made subsequent to Figure 27-1 were made for sound reasons. What\\nwe need is a hybrid that mixes the best of both schemes.\\nFigure 27-9 employs the BRIDGE pattern to extract the true API from the TemperatureSensor. The intent\\nof this pattern is to separate an implementation from an abstraction, so that both may vary independently. In our\\ncase, the TemperatureSensor is the abstraction, and the TemperatureSensorImp is the implementation.\\nNotice that the word “implementation” is being used to describe an abstract interface and that the “implementa-\\ntion” is itself implemented by the Nimbus1.0TemperatureSensor class.\\nCreational Issues. Look again at Figure 27-9. In order for this to work, a TemperatureSensor object\\nmust be created and bound to a Nimbus1.0TemperatureSensor object. Who takes care of this?

There are several portions of this software that we would like to\\nrelease and distribute separately. The API and each of its instantiations are reusable without the rest of the applica-\\ntion and may be used by the testing and quality assurance teams. The UI and sensors should be separate so that\\nthey can vary indepedently. After all, newer products may have better UI’s on top of the same system architecture.\\nIn fact, Release II will be the ﬁrst example of this.\\nFigure 27-13 shows a package structure for Phase I. This package structure nearly falls out of the classes we\\nhave designed so far. There is one package for each platform, and the classes in those packages derive from the\\nclasses in the API package. The sole client of the API package is the WeatherMonitoringSystem package,\\nwhich holds all the other classes.\\nEven though Release I has a very small UI, it is unfortunate that it is mixed in with the Weather-\\nMonitoringSystem classes. It would be better to put this class in a separate package. However, we have a prob-\\nlem. As things stand, the WeatherStation object creates the MonitoringScreen object, but the\\nMonitoringScreen object must know about all the sensors in order to add its observers through their\\nObservable interface. Thus, if we were to pull the MonitoringScreen out into its own package, there would be\\na cyclic dependency between that package and the WeatherMonitoringSystem package. This violates the\\nacyclic-dependencies principle (ADP) and would make the two packages impossible to release independently of\\neach other.\\nWe can ﬁx this by pulling the main program out of the WeatherStation class. WeatherStation still cre-\\nates the StationToolkit and all the sensors, but it does not create the MonitoringScreen. The main program\\nwill create the MonitoringScreen and the WeatherStation. The main program will then pass the\\nWeatherStation to the MonitoringScreen so that the MonitoringScreen can add its observers to the\\nsensors.\\nFigure 27-13 Phase I Package Structure\\nC API\\nTest\\n+ TestToolkit\\n- TestTemperature\\n- TestBarometricPressure\\n- TestAlarmClock\\nWeather\\nMonitoring\\nSystem\\n- TemperatureSensor\\n- BarometricPressureSensor\\n- AlarmClock\\n- MonitoringScreen\\n+ AlarmClockListener\\n+ WeatherStation\\nAPI\\n+ TemperatureSensorImp\\n+ BarometricPressureSensorImp\\n+ AlarmClockImp\\n+ StationToolkit\\n+ ClockListener\\nNimbus 1.0\\n+ Nimbus1.0Toolkit\\n- Nimbus1.0Temperature\\n- Nimbus1.0BarometricPressure\\n- Nimbus1.0AlarmClock\\nNimbus 2.0\\n+ Nimbus2.0Toolkit\\n- Nimbus2.0Temperature\\n- Nimbus2.0BarometricPressure\\n- Nimbus2.0AlarmClock\\n367\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

The only restric-\\ntion is that such objects must implement the Serializable interface, a very minimal restriction.\\n24-Hour History. Having decided on the low-level mechanism for storing persistent data, let’s look at the\\nkind of data that will be persistent. Our spec says that we must keep a record of the high and low readings for the\\nprevious 24-hour period. Figure 27-23 on page 380 shows a graph with these data. This graph does not seem to\\nmake a lot of sense. The high and low readings are painfully redundant. Worse, they come from the last 24-hours\\non the clock and not from the previous calendar day. Usually, when we want the last 24-hour high and low reading,\\nwe want it for the previous calendar day.\\nIs this a ﬂaw in the spec or a ﬂaw in our interpretation? It will do us no good to implement something\\naccording to the spec if the spec is not really what the customer wants. \\nA quick veriﬁcation with the stakeholders shows our intuition to be correct. We do indeed want to keep a\\nrolling history of the last 24 hours. However, the historical low and high need to be for the previous calendar day.\\nThe 24-hour High and Low. The daily high and low values will be based upon real-time readings of the\\nsensors. For example, every time the temperature changes, the 24-hour high and low temperatures will be updated\\nappropriately. Clearly, this is an OBSERVER relationship. Figure 27-17 shows the static structure, and Figure 27-18\\nshows the relevant dynamic scenarios.\\nWe have chosen to show the OBSERVER pattern using an association marked with the «observes» stereotype.\\nWe have created a class called TemperatureHiLo that is woken up by the AlarmClock every day at midnight.\\nNotice that the wakeEveryDay method has been added to AlarmClock. \\nUpon construction of the TemperatureHiLo object, it registers with both the AlarmClock and with the\\nTemperatureSensor. Whenever the temperature changes, the TemperatureHiLo object is notiﬁed through the\\nOBSERVER pattern. TemperatureHiLo then informs the HiLoData interface using the currentReading\\nFigure 27-16 Weather Station Component Package Diagram\\nMain\\n+ main() {static}\\n+ MonitoringScreen\\nUI\\n+ WeatherStationComponent\\nWeather\\nMonitoring\\nSystem\\nWeather\\nStation\\nComponent\\n- TemperatureSensor\\n- BarometricPressureSensor\\n- AlarmClock\\n+ WeatherStation\\nAPI\\n+ TemperatureSensorImp\\n+ BarometricPressureSensorImp\\n+ AlarmClockImp\\n+ StationToolkit\\n370\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

HiLoData will have to be implemented with some class that knows how to store the high and low values\\nfor the current 24-hour calendar day.\\nWe have separated the TemperatureHiLo class from the HiLoData class for two reasons. First of all, we\\nwanted to separate the knowledge of the TemperatureSensor and AlarmClock from the algorithms that deter-\\nmined the daily highs and lows. Second, and more importantly, the algorithm for determining the daily highs and\\nlows can be reused for barometric pressure, wind speed, dew point, etc. Thus, though we will need\\nBarometricPressureHiLo, DewPointHiLo, WindSpeedHiLo, etc. to observe the appropriate sensors, each\\nwill be able to use the HiLoData class to compute and store the data.\\nAt midnight, the AlarmClock sends the wakeup message to the TemperatureHiLo object.\\nTemperatureHiLo responds by fetching the current temperature from the TemperatureSensor and forwarding\\nit to the HiLoData interface. The implementation of HiLoData will have to store the previous calendar day’s val-\\nues using the PersistentImp interface and will also have to create a new calendar day with the initial value.\\nPersistentImp accesses objects in the persistent store using a string. This string acts as an access key.\\nOur HiLoData objects will be stored and retrieved with strings that have the following format:\\n“<type>+HiLo+<MM><dd><yyyy>.” For example, “temperatureHiLo04161998.” \\nImplementing the HiLo Algorithms\\nHow do we implement the HiLoData class?

Finally, if currentReading discovers that there was a change in the high or\\nlow data, it returns true, and the Store function is invoked to make sure that the persistent memory is updated.\\nThe currentReading method is the heart of this class. It compares the old high and low values with the\\nnew incoming reading.

First, it stores the current HiLoData in persistent memory.\\nThen it resets the values of the HiLoData for the beginning of a new day. It recomputes the storage key for the\\nnew date and then stores the new HiLoData in persistent memory.\\nThe Store function simply uses the current storage key to write the HiLoData object into persistent mem-\\nory through the PersistentImp object.\\nFinally, the calculateStorageKey method builds a storage key from the type of the HiLoData and the\\ndate argument.\\nUgliness. Certainly the code in Listing 27-8 is not too difﬁcult to understand. However, there is ugliness\\nfor another reason. The policy embodied in the functions currentReading and newDay have to do with manag-\\ning the high-low data and are independent of persistence. On the other hand, the store, and calculate-\\nStorageKey methods, the constructor, and the transient variables are all speciﬁc to persistence and have\\nnothing to do with the management of the highs and lows. This is a violation of the SRP.\\nIn its current commingled state, this class has the makings of a maintenance nightmare. If something funda-\\nmental about the persistence mechanism changes, to the extent that the calculateStorageKey and store func-\\ntions become inappropriate, then new persistence facilities will have to be grafted into the class. Functions like\\nnewDay and currentReading will have to be altered to invoke the new persistence facilities.\\nDecoupling Persistence from Policy. We can avoid these potential problems by decoupling the high-low\\ndata-management policy from the persistence mechanism using the P ROXY pattern. Look back at Figure 26-7 on\\npage 346. Note the decoupling of the policy layer (application) from the mechanism layer (API). \\nFigure 27-19 employs the PROXY pattern to effect the necessary decoupling. It differs from Figure 27-17 on\\npage 371 by the addition of the HiLoDataProxy class. It is the proxy class to which the TemperatureHiLo\\nobject actually holds a reference. The proxy, in turn, holds a reference to a HiLoDataImp object and delegates\\ncalls to it.

Furthermore,\\nnotice how the proxy depends on both HiLoDataImp (the policy layer) and PersistentImp (the mechanism\\nlayer). This is exactly what we were after.\\nBut all is not perfect. The astute reader will have caught the change that we made to the currentReading\\nmethod. We changed it to return a boolean. We need this boolean in the proxy so that the proxy knows when to\\ncall store. Why don’t we call store every time currentReading is called? There are many varieties of\\nNVRAM.

Yet somebody is going to have to create\\nthe HiLoDataProxy for the TemperatureHiLo object to use. Also, someone is going to have to create the\\nHiLoDataImp to which the proxy delegates. \\nWhat we need is a way to create objects without knowing exactly what type of object we are creating. We\\nneed a way for TemperatureHiLo to create a HiLoData without knowing that it is really creating a\\nHiLoDataProxy and a HiLoDataImp. Again, we fall back on the FACTORY pattern. (See Figure 27-20.)\\nTemperatureHiLo uses the DataToolkit interface to create an object that conforms to the HiLoData\\ninterface. The getTempHiLoData method gets deployed to a DataToolkitImp object, which creates a\\nHiLoDataProxy whose type code is “Temp” and returns it as a HiLoData.\\nThis solves the creation problem nicely. TemperatureHiLo does not need to depend upon the\\nHiLoDataProxy in order to create it. But how does TemperatureHiLo gain access to the DataToolkitImp\\nobject? We don’t want TemperatureHiLo to know anything about DataTookitImp because that would create a\\ndependency from the policy layer to the mechanism layer.\\nPackage Structure.

All the classes in the wmsdata\\npackage, other than Scope, are interfaces that have abstract methods and no variables. But the wmsdata.Scope\\nclass has a variable and no functions. On the other hand, all the classes in the persistence package, other than\\nScope, are concrete classes that have variables. But persistence.Scope has a function and no variables. \\nFigure 27-22 shows how this might be depicted in a class diagram. The Scope classes are «utility»\\nclasses. All the members of such classes, whether variables or functions, are static—a ﬁnal element to the sym-\\nmetry. It would appear that packages which contain abstract interfaces tend to contain utilities that have data and\\nno functions, whereas packages which contain concrete classes tend to contain utilities that have functions\\nand no data.\\nSo, Who Calls persistence.Scope.init()?  Probably the main() function. The class that holds\\nthat main function must be in a package that does not mind a dependency upon persistence. We often call the\\npackage that contains main the root package.\\nBut You Said... The persistence-implementation layer should not depend on the policy layer. However, a\\nclose inspection of Figure 27-21 shows a dependency from the persistence to wmsDataImp. This dependency\\ncan be traced back to Figure 27-20, in which HiLoDataProxy depends on HiLoDataImp. The reason for this\\ndependency is so HiLoDataProxy can create the HiLoDataImp that it depends on. \\nIn most cases, the proxy will not have to create the imp because the proxy will be reading the imp from per-\\nsistent store. That is, the HiLoDataImp will be returned to the proxy by a call to PersistentImp.retrieve.\\nHowever, in those rare cases where the retrieve function does not ﬁnd an object in the persistent store, HiLoData-\\nProxy is going to have to create an empty HiLoDataImp.\\nSo, it looks like we need another factory that knows how to create HiLoDataImp instances and that the\\nproxy can call. This means more packages and more Scope classes, etc.\\nIs This Really Necessary? Probably not in this case. We created the factory for the proxy because we\\nwanted TemperatureHiLo to be able to work with many different persistence mechanisms. Thus, we had a\\nsolid beneﬁt to justify the DataToolkit factory. But what beneﬁt would be obtained from interposing a\\nfactory between HiLoDataProxy and HiLoDataImp? If there could be many different implementations of\\nHiLoDataImp, and if we wanted the proxy to work with them all, then we might be justiﬁed. \\nHowever, we don’t believe that the requirements are quite that volatile. The wmsDataImp package contains\\nweather-monitoring policies and business rules that have remained unchanged for quite a while. It seems unlikely\\nthat they will be changing any time in the future. This may sound like famous last words, but you have to draw the\\nline somewhere. In this case, we have decided that the dependency from the proxy to the imp does not represent a\\nbig maintenance risk, and we will live without the factory.\\nFigure 27-22 Scope Utilities\\nDataToolkit\\nDataToolkitlmp\\n«interface»\\npersistence.\\nScope\\n«utility»\\n«creates»\\nwmsdata.Scope\\n«utility»\\n378\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

The ﬁrst is to create an architecture that will support the bulk of the application in a\\nmanner that is independent of the Nimbus hardware platform. The second goal is to manage the two biggest risks:\\n1. Getting the old Nimbus 1.0 API to work on the processor board with a new operating system. This is cer-\\ntainly doable, but it is very hard to estimate how long this will take because we cannot anticipate all the \\nincompatibilities. \\n2. The Java Virtual Machine. We have never used a JVM on an embedded board before. We don’t know if it \\nwill work with our operating system, or even if it correctly implements all of the Java byte codes properly. \\nOur suppliers assure us that everything will be ﬁne, but we still perceive a signiﬁcant risk.\\n381\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

For example, suppose you have a hierarchy of Modem objects. The base class has the\\ngeneric methods common to all modems. The derivatives represent the drivers for many different modem manu-\\nfacturers and types. Suppose also that you have a requirement to add a new method, named configureForUnix,\\nto the hierarchy. This method will conﬁgure the modem to work with the UNIX operating system. It will do some-\\nthing different in each modem derivative, because each different modem has its own particular idiosyncrasies for\\nsetting its conﬁguration and dealing with UNIX. \\nUnfortunately, adding configureForUnix begs a terrible set of questions. What about Windows? What\\nabout MacOs? What about Linux? Must we really add a new method to the Modem hierarchy for every new operat-\\ning system that we use? Clearly this is ugly. We’ll never be able to close the Modem interface. Every time a new\\noperating system comes along, we’ll have to change that interface and redeploy all the modem software.\\nFrom Chapter 28 of Agile Software Development, Principles, Patterns, and Practices, First Edition.

The appropriate Modem\\nderivative will then call visit(this) on ModemVisitor, the base class of UnixModemConfigurator. If that\\nderivative is a Hayes, then visit(this) will call public void visit(Hayes). This will deploy to the\\npublic void visit(Hayes) function in UnixModemConfigurator, which then conﬁgures the Hayes modem\\nfor Unix.\\nHaving built this structure, new operating-system conﬁguration functions can be added by adding new deriv-\\natives of ModemVisitor without altering the Modem hierarchy in any way. So the V ISITOR pattern substitutes\\nderivatives of ModemVisitor for methods in the Modem hierarchy.\\nThis is called dual dispatch because it involves two polymorphic dispatches. The ﬁrst is the accept func-\\ntion. This dispatch resolves the type of the object that accept is called upon. The second dispatch is the visit\\nmethod which resolves to the particular function to be executed. These two dispatches give VISITOR very fast exe-\\ncution speed.\\nVISITOR Is Like a Matrix\\nThe two dispatches of V ISITOR form a matrix of functions. In our modem example, one axis of the matrix is the\\ndifferent types of modems. The other axis is the different types of operating systems. Every cell in this matrix is\\nﬁlled in with a function that describes how to initialize the particular modem for the particular operating system.\\nACYCLIC VISITOR\\nNotice that the base class of the visited ( Modem) hierarchy depends on the base class of the visitor hierarchy\\n(ModemVisitor). Notice also that the base class of the visitor hierarchy has a function for each derivative of the\\nvisited hierarchy. Thus, there is a cycle of dependencies that ties all the visited derivatives (all the Modems)\\ntogether. This makes it very difﬁcult to compile the visitor structure incrementally or to add new derivatives to the\\nvisited hierarchy. \\n391\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

If Hayes, Zoom, and Ernie were the only Modem derivatives that were likely to be needed, or if the\\nincidence of new Modem derivatives was expected to be infrequent, then the VISITOR would be very appropriate. \\nOn the other hand, if the visited hierarchy is highly volatile, such that many new derivatives will need to be\\ncreated, then the Visitor base class (e.g., ModemVisitor) will have to be modiﬁed and recompiled along with\\nall its derivatives every time a new derivative is added to the visited hierarchy. In C++, the situation is even worse.\\nThe entire visited hierarchy must be recompiled and redeployed whenever any new derivative is added.\\nTo solve these problems, a variation known as ACYCLIC VISITOR can be used.2 (See Figure 28-3.) This vari-\\nation breaks the dependency cycle by making the Visitor base class (ModemVisitor) degenerate.3 The lack of\\nany methods in this class means that it does not depend on the derivatives of the visited hierarchy. \\nThe visitor derivatives also derive from visitor interfaces. There is one visitor interface for each derivative of\\nthe visited hierarchy. This is a 180˚ rotation from derivatives to interfaces.

ACYCLIC VISITOR creates the a sparse matrix. The visitor classes do not have to implement\\nvisit functions for each visited derivative. For example, if Ernie modems cannot be conﬁgured for U NIX, then\\nthe UnixModemConfigurator will not implement the ErnieVisitor interface. Thus the ACYCLIC VISITOR pat-\\ntern allows us to ignore certain combinations of derivatives and functions. This can sometimes be a useful\\nadvantage.\\nUsing VISITOR in Report Generators\\nA very common use of the V ISITOR pattern is to walk large data structures and generate reports. This keeps the\\ndata-structure objects from having any report-generation code. New reports can be added by adding new VISITORs,\\nrather than by changing the code in the data structures. This means that reports can be placed in separate compo-\\nnents and individually deployed only to those customers who need them.\\nConsider a simple data structure that represents a bill of materials. (See Figure 28-4.) There is an unlimited\\nnumber of reports that we could generate from this data structure. For example, we could generate a report of the\\ntotal cost of an assembly, or we could generate a report that listed all the piece parts in an assembly. \\nEach of these reports could be generated by methods in the Part class. For example, getExplodedCost\\nand getPieceCount could be added to the Part class. These methods would be implemented in each derivative\\nof Part, such that the appropriate reporting was accomplished. Unfortunately, that would mean that every new\\nreport that the customers wanted would force us to change the Part hierarchy.\\nThe Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) told us that we want to separate code that changes for different\\nreasons. The Part hierarchy may change as new kinds of parts are needed. However, it should not change because\\nnew kinds of reports are needed. Thus we’d like to separate the reports from the Part hierarchy. The V ISITOR\\nstructure we saw in Figure 28-4 shows how this can be accomplished.\\nEach new report can be written as a new visitor. We write the accept function of Assembly to visit the vis-\\nitor and also call accept on all the contained Part instances. Thus, the entire tree is traversed. For each node in\\nthe tree, the appropriate visit function is called on the report. The report accumulates the necessary statistics.\\nThe report can then be queried for the interesting data and presented to the user.\\nThis structure allows us to create an unlimited number of reports without affecting the Part hierarchy at all.\\nMoreover, each report can be compiled and distributed independently of all the others. This is nice.

One could imagine the different sub-\\nsystems of the application initializing themselves from the conﬁguration data by walking it with their own\\nparticular visitors. \\nIn every case where visitors are used, the data structure being used is independent of the uses to which\\nit is being put.

Another pat-\\ntern that accomplishes this is the DECORATOR. \\nConsider, once again, the Modem hierarchy in Figure 28-1. Imagine that we have an application which has\\nmany users. Each user, sitting at his computer, can ask the system to call out to another computer using the com-\\nputer’s modem. Some of the users like to hear their modems dial. Others like their modems to be silent. \\nWe could implement this by querying the user preferences at every location in the code where the modem is\\ndialed. If the user wants to hear the modem, we set the speaker volume high. Otherwise, we turn it off.\\n...\\nModem m = user.getModem();\\nif (user.wantsLoudDial())\\n  m.setVolume(11); // its one more than 10, isn’t it?\\nm.dial(...);\\n...\\nThe spectre of seeing this stretch of code duplicated hundreds of times throughout the application conjures images\\nof 80-hour weeks and heinous debugging sessions. It is something to be avoided. \\nAnother option would be to set a ﬂag in the modem object itself and have the dial method inspect it and set\\nthe volume accordingly.\\n...\\npublic class HayesModem implements Modem\\n{\\n  private boolean wantsLoudDial = false;\\n  public void dial(...)\\n  {\\n    if (wantsLoudDial)\\n    {\\n      setVolume(11);\\n    }\\n    ...\\n  }\\n  ...\\n}\\nThis is better, but it must still be duplicated for every derivative of Modem. Authors of new derivatives of Modem\\nmust remember to replicate this code. Depending on programmers memories is pretty risky business. \\nWe could resolve this with the TEMPLATE METHOD6 pattern by changing Modem from an interface to a class,\\nhaving it hold the wantsLoudDial variable, and having it test that variable in the dial function before it calls the\\ndialForReal function.\\n...\\npublic abstract class Modem\\n{\\n  private boolean wantsLoudDial = false;\\n  public void dial(...)\\n5.

Why should Modem\\nknow about loud dialing. Must it then be modiﬁed every time the user has some other odd request, like logging out\\nbefore hangup? \\nOnce again the Common-Closure Principle (CCP) comes into play. We want to separate those things that\\nchange for different reasons. We can also invoke the Single-Responsibility Principle (SRP) since the need to dial\\nloudly has nothing to do with the intrinsic functions of Modem and should therefore not be part of Modem.\\nDECORATOR solves the issue by creating a completely new class named LoudDialModem. LoudDialModem\\nderives from Modem and delegates to a contained instance of Modem. It catches the dial function and sets the vol-\\nume high before delegating. Figure 28-5 shows the structure.\\nNow the decision to dial loudly can be made in one place. At the place in the code where the user sets his\\npreferences, if he requests loud dialing, a LoudDialModem can be created, and the user’s modem can be passed\\ninto it. LoudDialModem will delegate all calls made to it to the user’s modem, so the user won’t notice any differ-\\nence. The dial method, however, will ﬁrst set the volume high before it delegates to the user’s modem. The\\nLoudDialModem can then become the user’s modem without anybody else in the system being affected.

This pattern is more complex than the others, but it is also much more powerful and ﬂexible.\\nEach object in the hierarchy maintains a list of special extension objects. Each object also provides a method that\\nallows the extension object to be looked up by name. The extension object provides methods that manipulate the\\noriginal hierarchy object.\\nFor example, let’s assume that we have a bill-of-materials system again. We need to develop the ability for\\neach object in this hierarchy to create an XML representation of itself. We could put toXML methods in the hierar-\\nchy, but this would violate the SRP. It may be that we don’t want BOM stuff and XML stuff in the same class. We\\ncould create XML using a VISITOR, but that doesn’t allow us to separate the XML generating code for each type of\\nBOM object. In a VISITOR, all the XML generating code for each BOM class would be in the same VISITOR object.\\nWhat if we want to separate the XML generation for each different BOM object into its own class? \\nEXTENSION OBJECT provides a nice way to accomplish this goal. The code in Listings 28-30 through 28-41\\nshows the BOM hierarchy with two different kinds of extension object. One kind of extension object converts\\nBOM objects into XML. The other kind of extension object converts BOM objects into CSV (comma-separated\\nvalue) strings. The ﬁrst kind is accessed by getExtension(“XML”) and the second by getExtension(“CSV”).\\nThe structure is shown in Figure 28-7 and was taken from the completed code. The «marker» stereotype denotes a\\nmarker interface (i.e., an interface with no methods).\\nIt is very important to understand that I did not simply write this code in Listings 28-30 through 28-41 from\\nscratch. Rather, I evolved the code from test case to test case. The ﬁrst source ﬁle, Listing 28-30, shows all the test\\ncases. They were written in the order shown. Each test case was written before there was any code that could make\\nit pass. Once each test case was written and failing, the code that made it pass was written. The code was never\\nmore complicated than necessary to make the existing test cases pass. Thus, the code evolved in tiny increments\\n7. [PLOPD3], p. 79.\\n408\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

Thus, they help us maintain the OCP. They also provide mechanisms for\\nsegregating different kinds of functionality, thus keeping classes from getting cluttered with many different func-\\ntions. As such, they help us maintain the CCP. It should be clear that the SRP, LSP, and DIP are also applied to the\\nstructure of the VISITOR family.\\nThe VISITOR patterns are seductive. It is easy to get carried away with them. Use them when they help, but\\nmaintain a healthy skepticism about their necessity.

The bubbles are called states. Connecting the states are arrows\\ncalled transitions. The transitions are labeled with the name of an event followed by the name of an action. The\\nSTD in Figure 29-1 is read as follows:\\n•If the machine is in the Locked state and we get a coin event, then we transition to the Unlocked state and \\ninvoke the unlock action.\\n•If the machine is in the Unlocked state and we get a pass event, then we transition to the Locked state and \\ninvoke the lock action.\\nThese two sentences completely describe the diagram in Figure 29-1. Each sentence describes one transition\\narrow in terms of four elements: the starting state, the event that triggers the transition, the ending state, and the\\naction to be performed. Indeed these transition sentences can be reduced to a simple table called a state transition\\ntable (STT). It might look like this:\\nLocked   coin   Unlocked   unlock\\nUnlocked Pass   Locked     lock\\nHow does this machine work? Presume that the FSM begins its life in the Locked state. A passenger walks\\nup to the turnstile and deposits a coin. This causes the software to receive the coin event. The ﬁrst transition in the\\nSTT says that if we are in the Locked state and we get a coin event, then we will transition to the Unlocked state\\nand invoke the unlock action. So the software changes its state to Unlocked and calls the unlock function. The\\npassenger then passes through the gate causing the software to detect a pass event. Since the FSM is now in the\\nUnlocked state, the second transition is invoked, forcing the machine back to the Locked state and causing the\\nlock function to be called.\\nClearly the STD and the STT are both simple and elegant descriptions of the behavior of the machine. But\\nthey are also very powerful design tools. One of the beneﬁts they convey is the ease with which the designer can\\ndetect strange and unhandled conditions. For example, examine each state in Figure 29-1 and apply both known\\nevents. Notice that there is no transition to handle a coin event in the Unlocked state, nor is there a transition to\\nhandle a pass event in the Locked state.\\nThese omissions are serious logic ﬂaws and are a very common source of programmer error. Programmers\\noften consider the normal course of events more thoroughly than they consider the abnormal possibilities. The\\nSTD or STT gives the programmer a way to easily check that the design handles every event in every state.\\nWe can ﬁx the FSM by adding the necessary transitions. The new version is shown in Figure 29-2. Here we\\ncan see that if the passenger deposits more coins after the ﬁrst, the machine remains in the Unlocked state and\\nlights up a little “thank-you” light encouraging the passenger to continue to enter coins. 3 Also, if the passenger\\nmanages to pass through the gate while it is locked (perhaps with the aid of a sledge hammer) then the FSM will\\nremain in the Locked state and will sound an alarm.\\nFigure 29-1 Simple Turnstile FSM\\n3. ;^)\\nUnlocked\\nLocked coin/unlock\\npass/lock\\n420\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

Notice the four test functions named testCoinInLockedState,\\ntestCoinInUnlockedState, testPassInLockedState, and testPassInUnlockedState. These functions\\ntest the four transitions of the FSM separately. They do this by forcing the state variable of the Turnstile to\\nthe state they want to check, and then invoking the event they want to verify. In order for the test to access the\\nstate variable, it cannot be private. Thus, I’ve made it package scope and added a comment indicating that my\\nintent is that the variable is private.\\nObject-oriented dogma insists that all instance variables of a class ought to be private. I have blatantly\\nignored this rule, and by doing so, I have broken the encapsulation of Turnstile. \\nOr have I?\\nMake no mistake about it, I would rather have kept the state variable private. However, to do so would\\nhave denied my test code the ability to force its value. I could have created the appropriate setState and\\ngetState methods at package scope, but that seems ridiculous. I was not trying to expose the state variable to\\nany class other than TestTurnstile, so why should I create a setter and a getter that imply that anyone at pack-\\nage scope can get and set that variable? \\nOne of Java’s unfortunate weaknesses is the lack of anything like the C++ friend concept. If Java had a\\nfriend statement, then I could have kept state private and declared TestTurnstile to be a friend of\\nTurnstile. However, as things are, I think that putting state at package scope and using the comment to\\ndeclare my intent is the best option.\\nTesting the Actions. Notice the TurnstileController interface in Listing 29-2. This was put in place\\nspeciﬁcally so that the TestTurnstile class could ensure that the Turnstile class was invoking the right\\naction methods in the right order. Without this interface, it would have been much more difﬁcult to ensure that the\\nstate machine was working properly.\\nThis is an example of the impact that testing has upon design. Had I simply written the state machine with-\\nout thought to testing, it is unlikely that I would have created the TurnstileController interface. That would\\nhave been unfortunate. The TurnstileController interface nicely decouples the logic of the ﬁnite state\\nmachine from the actions it needs to perform. Another FSM, using very different logic, can use the\\nTurnstileController without any impact at all.\\nThe need to create test code that veriﬁes each unit in isolation forces us to decouple the code in ways we\\nmight not otherwise think of. Thus, testability is a force that drives the design to a less coupled state.\\nCosts and Beneﬁts of the Nested Switch/Case Implementation. For simple state machines, the nested\\nswitch/case implementation is both elegant and efﬁcient. All the states and events are visible on one or two pages\\nof code. However, for larger FSMs the situation changes. In a state machine with dozens of states and events, the\\ncode devolves into page after page of case statements. There are no convenient locators to help you see where, in\\nthe state machine, you are reading. Maintaining long, nested switch/case statements can be a very difﬁcult and\\nerror-prone job.\\nAnother cost of the nested switch/case is that there is no good separation between the logic of the ﬁnite state\\nmachine and the code that implements the actions. That separation is strongly present in Listing 29-1 because the\\nactions are implemented in a derivative of the TurnstileController. However, in most nested switch/case\\nFSMs that I have seen, the implementation of the actions is buried in the case statements. Indeed, this is still possi-\\nble in Listing 29-1.\\nInterpreting Transition Tables\\nA very common technique for implementing FSMs is to create a data table that describes the transitions. This table\\nis interpreted by an engine that handles the events. The engine looks up the transition that matches the event,\\ninvokes the appropriate action, and changes the state.\\n424\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

I have used mechanisms like that to allow hot patching of complex\\nﬁnite state machines. \\nStill another beneﬁt is that multiple tables can be created, each representing a different FSM logic. These\\ntables can be selected at run time based upon starting conditions.\\nThe cost of the approach is primarily speed. It takes time to search through the transition table. For large\\nstate machines, that time may become signiﬁcant. Another cost is the volume of code that must be written to sup-\\nport the table.

The diagram in Figure 29-3 is strongly reminiscent of the S TRATEGY5 pattern.\\nBoth have a context class; both delegate to a polymorphic base class that has several derivatives. The difference\\n(see Figure 29-4) is that, in STATE, the derivatives hold a reference back to the context class. The primary function\\nof the derivatives is to select and invoke methods of the context class through that reference. In the STRATEGY pat-\\ntern, no such constraint or intent exists. The derivatives of a STRATEGY are not required to hold a reference to the\\ncontext, and they are not required to call methods on the context. Thus, all instances of the S TATE pattern are also\\ninstances of the STRATEGY pattern, but not all instances of STRATEGY are STATE.\\nCosts and Beneﬁts of the STATE Pattern. The STATE pattern provides a very strong separation between\\nthe actions and the logic of the state machine. The actions are implemented in the Context class, and the logic is\\ndistributed through the derivatives of the State class. This makes it very simple to change one without affecting\\nthe other. For example, it would be very easy to reuse the actions of the Context class with a different state logic\\n5. See “Strategy” on page 168.\\n428\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

We can also implement the actions in many\\ndifferent ways simply by deriving from Turnstile. \\nNotice that the generated code is completely isolated from the code that you have to write. You never have to\\nmodify the generated code. You don’t even have to look at it. You can pay it the same level of attention that you pay\\nto binary code. \\nYou can see the generated code, as well as the other support code for this example, in Listing 29-13 through\\nListing 29-15 in the Listings section at the end of the chapter.\\nCosts and Beneﬁts of the SMC Approach to the STATE Pattern. Clearly we have managed to maxi-\\nmize the beneﬁts of the various approaches. The description of the ﬁnite state machine is contained all in one place\\nand is very easy to maintain. The logic of the ﬁnite state machine is strongly isolated from the implementation of\\nthe actions, enabling both to be changed without impact upon the other. The solution is efﬁcient, elegant, and\\nrequires a minimum of coding.\\nThe cost is in the use of SMC. You have to have, and to learn how to use, another tool.

At\\nthe time, computer interfaces were dominated by textual approaches using hierarchical menus. It was easy to\\nget lost in the menu structure, not knowing what state the screen was in. GUIs helped mitigate that problem by\\nminimizing the number of state changes that the screen went through. In modern GUIs, a great deal of work is\\nput in to keeping common features on the screen at all times and making sure the user does not get confused by\\nhidden states.\\nIt is ironic, then, that the code implementing these “stateless” GUIs, is strongly state driven. In such GUIs,\\nthe code must ﬁgure out which menu items and buttons to grey out, which subwindows should appear, which tab\\nshould be activated, where the focus ought to be put, etc. All these decisions relate to the state of the interface.\\nI learned a very long time ago that controlling these factors is a nightmare unless you organize them into a\\nsingle control structure. That control structure is best characterized as an FSM. Since those days, I have been writ-\\ning almost all my GUIs using FSMs generated by SMC (or its predecessors).\\nConsider the state machine in Listing 29-11. This machine controls the GUI for the login portion of an appli-\\ncation. Upon getting a start event, the machine puts up a login screen. Once the user hits the enter key, the machine\\nchecks the password. If the password is good, it goes to the loggedIn state and starts the user process (not\\nshown). If the password is bad, it displays a screen informing the user that his password is bad. If the user wants to\\ntry again, he hits the OK button; otherwise he hits the cancel button. If a bad password is entered three times in a\\nrow (thirdBadPassword event), the machine locks the screen until the administrator password is entered.\\nListing 29-11\\nlogin.sm\\nInitial init\\n{\\n  init\\n  {\\n    start logginIn displayLoginScreen\\n  }\\n  logginIn\\n  {\\n    enter checkingPassword checkPassword\\n    cancel init clearScreen\\n  }\\n  checkingPassword\\n  {\\n    passwordGood loggedIn startUserProcess\\n    passwordBad notifyingPasswordBad displayBadPasswordScreen\\n    thirdBadPassword screenLocked displayLockScreen\\n  }\\n  notifyingPasswordBad\\n  {\\n    OK checkingPassword displayLoginScreen\\n    cancel init clearScreen\\n  }\\n432\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

This high-\\nlevel policy lives in one place and is easy to maintain. It vastly simpliﬁes the rest of the code in the system because\\nthat code is not mixed with the policy code.\\nClearly this approach can be used for interfaces other than GUIs. Indeed, I have used similar approaches for\\ntextual and machine–machine interfaces as well. But GUIs tend to be more complex than those others, so the need\\nfor them and the volume of them are greater.\\nGUI Interaction Controllers\\nImagine you want to allow your users to draw rectangles on the screen. The gestures they use are as follows: First\\nthey click on the rectangle icon in the pallet window. Then they position the mouse in the canvas window at one\\ncorner of the rectangle. Then they press the mouse button and drag the mouse toward the desired second corner.\\nWhile the user drags, an animated image of the potential rectangle appears on the screen. The user manipulates the\\nrectangle to the desired shape by continuing to hold the mouse button down while dragging the mouse. When the\\nrectangle is right, the user releases the mouse button. The program then stops the animation and draws a ﬁxed rect-\\nangle on the screen.\\nOf course, the user can abort this at any time by clicking on a different pallet icon. If the user drags the\\nmouse out of the canvas window, the animation disappears. If the mouse returns to the canvas window, the anima-\\ntion reappears.\\nFinally, having ﬁnished drawing a rectangle, the user can draw another simply by clicking and dragging\\nagain in the canvas window. There is no need to click on the rectangle icon in the pallet.\\nWhat I have described here is a ﬁnite state machine. The state transition diagram appears in Figure 29-6. The\\nsolid circle with the arrow denotes the starting state of the state machine. 7 The solid circle with the open circle\\naround it is the ﬁnal state of the machine. \\nGUI interactions are rife with ﬁnite state machines. They are driven by the incoming events from the user.\\nThose events cause changes in the state of the interaction.\\nDistributed Processing\\nDistributed processing is yet another situation in which the state of the system changes based upon incoming\\nevents. For example, suppose you had to transfer a large block of information from one node on a network to\\nanother. Suppose also that network response time is precious, so you need to chop up the block and send it as a\\ngroup of small packets.\\nThe state machine depicting this scenario is shown in Figure 29-7. It starts by requesting a transmission ses-\\nsion, proceeds by sending each packet and waiting for an acknowledgment, and ﬁnishes by terminating the\\nsession. \\n7.

In the three graphical divisions\\nof the examination, candidates are asked to create solutions in a CAD-like environment by drawing or placing\\nobjects. For example, they might be asked to do the following:\\n•Design the ﬂoor plan of a certain kind of building\\n•Design a roof to ﬁt on top of an existing building\\n•Place a proposed building on a parcel of land and design the parking area, road system, and walkway system \\nto serve the building\\nIn the past, the candidates’ solutions to these problems were drawn using pencil and paper. These documents\\nwere then given to a cadre of jurors for scoring. The jurors were highly experienced architects who would pore\\nover the candidates’ solutions and decide whether to pass or fail them.\\nIn 1989, NCARB commissioned ETS to research whether or not an automated system for delivering and\\nscoring the graphical portions of the examination could be developed. By 1992, the ETS and the NCARB had\\nagreed that such a system was indeed possible. Furthermore, they felt that an object-oriented approach would be\\nappropriate due to the constantly changing requirements. So they contacted Object Mentor, Inc. (OMI) to help\\nwith the design.\\nIn March 1993, OMI was granted a contract to produce a portion of the test. One year later, after success-\\nfully completing that portion, OMI was granted a second contract to produce the bulk of the remainder.\\nProgram Structure. The structure that ETS decided on was quite elegant. The graphics examination\\nwould be broken into 15 different problems, called vignettes. Each vignette tested a particular area of knowledge.\\nOne might test the candidate’s understanding of roof design, and another might test their understanding of how to\\ndesign ﬂoor plans. \\nEach vignette was further subdivided into two sections. The “delivery” section was to be a graphical user\\ninterface upon which the candidate would “draw” the solution to the problem at hand. The “scoring” section was\\nto read the solution created by the delivery section and score it. Delivery would be conducted at a location\\nconvenient to the candidate. The solutions would then be transmitted to a central location where they would\\nbe scored.\\nScripts. Although there were only 15 vignettes, each would have many possible “scripts.” A script would\\nspecify the exact nature of the problem that the candidate would solve. For example, the ﬂoor-plan vignette might\\nhave one script that asked the candidate to design a library, and another that asked the candidate to design a gro-\\ncery store. Thus, the vignette programs had to be written in a generic fashion. They had to be delivered and scored\\nin a way that was governed by the script.\\nPlatform. Both the delivery and scoring programs were to run under Windows 3.1 (later upgraded to\\nW95/NT). The programs were to be written in C++ using object-oriented techniques. \\nFirst Contract. In March 1993, OMI was granted a contract to develop the delivery and scoring of the\\nmost complex of all the vignettes: “Building Design.” This decision was motivated by Booch’s recommendation to\\ndevelop the highest-risk elements ﬁrst as a way to manage risk and calibrate the estimation process of the team.\\nBuilding Design. Building Design was to test the candidate’s ability to design the ﬂoor plan of a rela-\\ntively simple two-story building. The candidate would be given a building to design, complete with requirements\\nand constraints. The candidate would then use the delivery program to place rooms, doors, windows, corridors,\\nstairs, and elevators into their solution. \\n444\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

The nature of these features is conﬁdential, but in general terms, they would assess\\nthings such as the following:\\n•Does the building meet the requirements of the client?\\n•Is the building code compliant?\\n•Has the candidate demonstrated design logic?\\n•Are the building and its rooms oriented correctly on the site?\\nEarly History 1993–1994\\nAt this early stage, two of us (Martin and Newkirk) were the sole developers working on this project. Our contract\\nwith ETS said that we were to produce both the delivery and scoring programs for Building Design. However, we\\nalso wanted to develop a reusable framework in conjunction with Building Design.\\nBy 1997, there had to be 15 vignette delivery and scoring programs operational. That gave us four years. We\\nfelt that a reusable framework would give us a big advantage toward that goal. Such a framework would also go a\\nlong way toward helping us manage the consistency and quality of the vignettes. After all, we didn’t want similar\\nfeatures in different vignettes to operate in subtly different ways.\\nSo, in March 1993, we set out to produce the two components of Building Design and also a framework that\\ncould be reused by the remaining fourteen vignettes.\\nSuccess. In September 1993, the ﬁrst versions of the delivery and scoring programs were complete, and\\nwe demonstrated these programs to representatives of NCARB and ETS. These demonstrations were well\\nreceived, and a ﬁeld trial was scheduled for January 1994.\\nAs with most projects, once users see the program actually operating, they realize that what they asked for\\nwas not really what they wanted. We had been sending interim versions of the vignette to ETS every week\\nthroughout 1993, and there had been a large number of changes and enhancements made right up to that Septem-\\nber demonstration. \\nAfter the demonstration, the looming ﬁeld trial caused the rate of changes and enhancements to reach deluge\\nproportions. The two of us were kept busy, full time, making and testing these changes and preparing the programs\\nfor the ﬁeld trial.\\nThis churning of the speciﬁcation for Building Design was accelerated still further by the results of the ﬁeld\\ntrial, keeping us even busier through the ﬁrst quarter of 1994.\\nIn December 1993, negotiations were begun for a contract to build the rest of the vignettes. These negoti-\\nations would take three months to close. In March 1994, ETS granted OMI a contract to produce a framework\\nand 10 more vignettes. ETS’s own engineers would produce the remaining ﬁve vignettes based upon our\\nframework.\\nFramework?\\nLate in 1993, at the height of the churn in Building Design, one of us (Newkirk) spent a week with one of the engi-\\nneers at ETS to prepare him for his part in the upcoming contract. The objective was to demonstrate how the code\\nwithin the 60,000-line, reusable C++ framework could be reused to build other vignettes. However, things did not\\ngo well. By the end of the week, it was clear that the only way to reuse the framework was to cut and paste bits and\\npieces of its source code into the new vignettes. Clearly this was not a good option.\\nIn hindsight, there were two reasons for our failure to create a workable framework. First, we had been\\nfocusing on Building Design to the exclusion of all the other vignettes. Second, we went through months of churn-\\ning requirements and schedule pressure. These two things together allowed concepts that were speciﬁc to Building\\nDesign to inﬁltrate the framework. \\n445\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

We felt that by\\nusing C++ and by doing a careful object-oriented design, a reusable framework would be easy to create. We were\\nwrong. We discovered what had been known for years—building reusable frameworks is hard.\\nFramework!\\nIn March 1994, after the new contract was signed, we added two more engineers to the project and began develop-\\ning the new vignettes. We still believed we needed a framework and were convinced that what we had would not\\nserve that function. It was clear we needed to change our strategy.\\nThe 1994 Team\\n•Robert C. Martin, architect and lead designer, 20+ years experience\\n•James W. Newkirk, designer and project leader, 15+ years experience\\n•Bhama Rao, designer and programmer, 12+ years experience\\n•William Mitchell, designer and programmer, 15+ years experience\\nThe Deadline\\nThe deadline was set by the fact that the test was to go into production in 1997. Candidates would be tested in Feb-\\nruary and scored in May. This was an absolute requirement.\\nThe Strategy\\nTo make that schedule and to ensure that the quality and consistency of the program could be managed, we\\nadopted a new strategy for the construction of the framework. Portions of the original 60,000-line framework were\\npreserved, but the majority was scrapped.\\nA Rejected Alternative. One option would have been to try to redesign the framework up front and com-\\nplete it before any of the vignettes were begun. Indeed, many people would identify this with an architecture-\\ndriven approach. However, we chose not to pursue this option, because it would have caused us to produce large\\namounts of framework code that could not be tested inside working vignettes. We did not trust our ability to com-\\npletely anticipate the needs of the vignettes. In short, we felt that the architecture needed almost immediate veriﬁ-\\ncation by being used in working vignettes. We did not want to guess.\\nRebecca Wirfs–Brock once said, “You have to build at least three or more applications against a framework\\n(and then throw them away) before you can be reasonably conﬁdent that you have built the right architecture for\\nthat domain.”2 After failing to produce a framework, we felt similarly. Thus, we decided that we would develop the\\nframework concurrently with the development of several new vignettes. This would allow us to compare similar\\nfeatures of the vignettes and design those features in a generic and reusable way. \\nFour vignettes were begun in parallel. As they were being developed, certain portions were found to be\\nsimilar. These were then refactored into more generic form and reﬁt into all three vignettes. Thus, nothing entered\\nthe framework unless it had been successfully reused in at least four vignettes.\\nAlso, portions of Building Design were excised and refactored in a similar fashion. Once these portions were\\nworking in all three vignettes, they were placed in the framework.\\nAmong the common features that were added to the framework were the following:\\n•The structure of the UI screen–Message windows, drawing windows, button palettes, etc. \\n•Creating, moving, adjusting, identifying, and deleting graphic elements\\n2.

But this framework was being reused by four different vignettes.\\nResults\\nThrowing One Away. What were we to do with the old Building Design? As the framework grew and the\\nnew vignettes were successfully reusing it, Building Design stood more and more as an outsider. It was unlike all\\nthe other vignettes and would have to be maintained and evolved through separate means. Even though Building\\nDesign represented over a man–year of effort, we decided to be ruthless and discard the old version completely.\\nWe committed ourselves to redesign and reimplement it later in the project cycle.\\nLong Initial Development Time.  A negative result of our framework strategy was the relatively long\\ndevelopment time for the ﬁrst vignettes. The ﬁrst four vignette delivery programs required nearly four man–years\\nto develop. \\nReuse Efﬁciency. Upon completion of the initial vignettes, the framework was richly endowed with\\n60,000 lines of C++ code, and the vignette delivery programs were remarkably small. Each program had approxi-\\nmately 4,000 lines of boiler-plate code (i.e., code that is the same for each vignette). Each program also had an\\naverage of 6,000 lines of application-speciﬁc code. The smallest vignette had as few as 500 lines of application-\\nspeciﬁc code, and the largest had as many as 12,000. We felt that it was remarkable that, on average, nearly ﬁve-\\nsixths of the code in each vignette was pulled from the framework. Only one-tenth of the code within these pro-\\ngrams was unique.\\nDevelopment Productivity. After the ﬁrst four vignettes, development time drastically decreased. Seven\\nmore delivery programs (including a rewrite of Building Design) were completed within 18 man–months. The\\nline-count ratios of these new vignettes remained roughly the same as the ﬁrst four.\\nMoreover, the Building Design program, which took us over one man–year to write the ﬁrst time, took\\nonly 2.5 man–months to rewrite from scratch with the framework in place. This is nearly a 6:1 increase in\\nproductivity.\\nAnother way to look at these results is that the ﬁrst ﬁve vignettes, including Building Design, required one\\nman–year of effort apiece. Subsequent vignettes, however, required 2.6 man–months apiece—an increase of\\nnearly 400 percent. \\nWeekly Delivery. From the outset of the project, and throughtout its active development, we shipped\\ninterim versions to ETS every week. ETS would test and evaluate these versions and then send us a list of changes.\\nWe would estimate these changes, and then work with ETS to schedule the week in which they’d be delivered. Dif-\\nﬁcult changes, or changes of low importance, were often delayed in preference to high priority changes. Thus, ETS\\nkept control of the project and schedule throughout.\\nA Robust and Flexible Design. One of the most satisfying aspects of the project is the way that the archi-\\ntecture and framework have weathered the intense ﬂux of requirements changes.

Yet, with all the modiﬁcations,\\nﬁddling, and tweaking in the midst of heavy development, “the design of the software didn’t unravel.”3\\nFinal Outcome. By February 1997, architectural candidates began using the delivery programs to take\\ntheir registration exams. By May 1997, their results began to be scored. The system has been up and running since\\nthat time, and it has worked well. Every architect candidate in North America now takes this exam using this soft-\\nware.\\nFramework Design\\nThe Common Requirements of the Scoring Applications\\nConsider the problem of how to test someone’s knowledge and skill. The scheme that was adopted by ETS for the\\nNCARB programs is quite elaborate. We can illustrate it here by exploring a simple, ﬁctitious example — a test for\\nbasic math.\\nIn our basic math test, students are presented with 100 math problems ranging from simple addition and sub-\\ntraction problems to large multiplication and long-division problems. We will examine their responses to these\\nproblems to ascertain their competency and skill in basic math. Our goal is to give them a pass/fail grade. “Pass”\\nmeans that we are certain that they have acquired the fundamental knowledge and skill needed for basic math.\\n“Fail” means that we are sure that they have not acquired this knowledge and skill. In those cases where we are\\nunsure, we will return a score of “indeterminate.”\\nHowever, we have another goal, too. We want to be able to enumerate the strengths and weaknesses of the\\nstudent. We want to partition the topic of basic math into subtopics and then evaluate the student for each of those\\nsubtopics. \\nConsider, for example, the problem of a person who has learned an improper multiplication fact. Perhaps\\nthey always mistake  for 42. This person will get a large percentage of the multiplication and division prob-\\nlems wrong. Certainly that student deserves to fail the test. On the other hand, consider that the student did every-\\nthing else correctly! The student correctly created the partial products in long multiplication and correctly\\nstructured the long-division problems. Indeed, the only mistake that the student made was = 42. Certainly\\nwe’d like to know that. Indeed, since the corrective action for such a student is so simple, we might very well want\\nto give the student a passing grade along with some corrective guidance.\\nSo how can we structure the scoring of the test to determine the areas of basic math in which the student has\\ngained expertise and those areas in which he or she has not? Consider the diagram in Figure 30-1. The rectangles\\non this diagram show areas of expertise that we want to test for. The lines show a hierarchical dependency.\\nThus, knowledge of basic math depends on knowledge of terms and factors. Knowledge of terms depends on\\nknowledge of addition facts plus the mechanics of addition and subtraction. Knowledge of addition depends\\nupon knowledge of the commutative and associative properties of addition and the mechanics of carrying.\\nThe leaf rectangles are called “features.” Features are units of knowledge that can be evaluated and given\\nacceptable (A), unacceptable (U), or indeterminate (I) values. Thus, given our 100 problems and the student’s\\nanswers, we want to apply each feature to every problem and determine a score. In the case of the “Carry” feature,\\nwe would look at every addition problem and compare it to the student’s answer. If the student got all the addition\\nproblems correct, the result of the “Carry” feature would, of course, be ‘A.’ However, for each addition problem\\nthat the student got wrong, we would try to determine if the error made was an error in carrying. We might try dif-\\nferent combinations of carrying errors to see if one of those errors would lead to the answer that the student gave.\\nIf we could determine, with a high degree of probability, that a carry error was made, we would adjust the score of\\nthe carry feature accordingly. In the end, the score returned by the carry feature would be a statistical result based\\nupon the total number of wrong answers that could be traced to errors in carrying.\\n3.

Notice on Figure 30-1 that there are matrix icons at the\\njunctures between the levels of the hierarchy. The matrix associates a weighting factor with the score from each\\nfeature and then provides a map for the score for that level in the hierarchy. For example, the matrix just below the\\nAddition node would establish the weights to be applied to the Carry and Properties scores, and would then\\ndescribe the mapping that would generate the overall score for Addition. \\nFigure 30-2 shows the form of one of these matrices. The input from Carry is considered more important that\\nthe input from Properties, so it is given twice the weight. The weighted scores are then added together, and the\\nresult is applied to the matrix.\\nFor example, let’s presume a score of ‘I’ from Carry, and a score of ‘A’ from Properties. There are no ‘U’\\nscores, so we use the left-most column of the matrix. The weighted ‘I’ score is 2, so we use the third row of the\\nmatrix, giving a result of ‘I.’ Notice that there are holes in the matrix. These are impossible conditions. Given the\\ncurrent weightings, there is no combination of scores that will select the empty cells in the matrix.\\nFigure 30-1 Feature Hierarchy for Basic Math\\nFigure 30-2 The Addition Matrix\\nBasic Math\\nLong\\nDivision\\nPartial\\nProducts\\nM1\\nTerms\\nM2\\nFactors\\nM3\\nFacts FactsAddition\\nM4\\nBorrow Properties\\nCarry Properties\\nDivision\\nM7\\nProperties\\nSubtraction\\nM5\\nProperties\\nMultiplication\\nM6\\n0123\\nA0I U U Inputs:\\nCarry X 2\\nProperties X 1\\nOutput:\\nAddition\\nA1IU\\nI2U\\nU\\nU3\\n449\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

How does the scoring tree get built? It was quite evident that the psychometricians at\\nETS would want the ability to change the topology and weighting of the tree without having to change the actual\\napplications. Thus the scoring tree is built up by the VignetteScoringApp class. (See Figure 30-3.)\\nEach scoring application had its own implementation for this class. One of the responsibilities of this class\\nwas to build a derivative of the FeatureDictionary class. This class contained a mapping of strings to\\nEvaluator pointers.\\nWhen a scoring application was started, the scoring framework gained control. It invoked the method in the\\nScoringApplication class that caused the appropriate derivative of the FeatureDictionary to be created. It\\nthen read a special text ﬁle that described the topology of the scoring tree and its weights. This text ﬁle identiﬁed\\nfeatures by using special names. These names were the names that were associated with the appropriate\\nEvaluator pointers in the FeatureDictionary.\\nThus, in its simplest form, a scoring application was nothing more than a set of features and a method that\\nconstructed a FeatureDictionary. The building and evaluation of the scoring tree was handled by the frame-\\nwork and was therefore common to all the scoring applications.\\nA Case for TEMPLATE METHOD\\nOne of the vignettes tested the candidates’ abilities to lay out the ﬂoor plan of a building such as a library or a\\npolice station. In this vignette, the candidate had to draw rooms, corridors, doors, windows, wall openings, stairs,\\nelevators, etc. The program converted the drawing into a data structure that the scoring program could interpret.\\nThe object model looked something like Figure 30-4. \\nMake no mistake about this. The objects in this data structure had very minimal functionality. They were not\\npolymorphic objects in any sense of the word. Rather, they were simple data carriers—A purely representational\\nmodel.\\nA building was composed of two ﬂoors. Each ﬂoor had many spaces. Each space contained many portals,\\neach of which separated two spaces. Portals could be windows or could allow a human to pass through. Human\\nportals were either wall openings or doors.\\nScoring was done by testing the solution for a set of features. The features were things like the following:\\n•Did the candidate draw all the required spaces?\\n•Does each space have an acceptable aspect ratio?\\nFigure 30-4 Floor Plan Data Structure\\nBuilding Floor\\nSpace Portal\\nHumanPortal\\nDoor Wall Opening\\nWindow\\n0..*\\n0..* 2\\n2\\n453\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

All the scor-\\ning features inherit it rather than reimplement it.\\nSome of the features had to measure characteristics of the portals attached to a space. So we reproduced the\\npattern and created the class PortalFeature derived from SolutionSpaceFeature. The implementation of\\nNewSolutionSpace within PortalFeature looped through all the portals in the SolutionSpace argument\\nand called the pure virtual function NewPortal(const Portal&). (See Figure 30-5.)\\nThis structure allowed us to create dozens of different scoring features, each one of which walked the ﬂoor-\\nplan data structure, without knowing what the ﬂoor-plan data structure looked like. If the details of the ﬂoor-plan\\ndata structure changed (e.g., we decided to use STL instead of our own iterators), we’d have to change two classes\\nrather than several dozen.\\nWhy did we choose T EMPLATE METHOD over STRATEGY?5 Consider how much looser the coupling would\\nhave been had we used STRATEGY! (See Figure 30-6.)\\nUsing the TEMPLATE METHOD structure, if we had to make a change to the algorithms that walked the data\\nstructure, we would have had to change SpaceFeature and PortalFeature. In all likelihood, this would have\\nforced us to recompile all the features. However, using the S TRATEGY pattern, the change would have been\\nrestricted to the two Driver classes. There is virtually no chance that the features would need to be recompiled.\\nSo why did we choose the TEMPLATE METHOD? Because it was simpler. Because the data structure was not\\nsomething that was going to change frequently. And because recompiling all the features cost just a few minutes. \\nSo, even though the use of inheritance in the TEMPLATE METHOD pattern resulted in a more tightly coupled\\ndesign, and even though the S TRATEGY pattern conforms to the DIP better than the T EMPLATE METHOD pattern\\ndoes, in the end it wasn’t worth the two extra classes to implement the STRATEGY.\\nThe Common Requirements of the Delivery Applications\\nThe delivery programs had quite a bit of overlap.

Indeed, most of the commands that were initiated in the command win-\\ndow required signiﬁcant interaction within the Task Window. \\nFor example, in order to place a room on a ﬂoor plan, the user would click on the Place Item button in the\\nCommand Window. A menu of possible rooms would pop up. The user would select the kind of room he wished to\\nplace into the ﬂoor plan. Then the user would move the mouse into the Task Window and click at the location\\nwhere he wanted the room to be placed.

Thus, we needed to ﬁnd a way to allow the vignettes the power to override the processing of events if\\nneeded.\\nThe problem was complicated by the fact that the list of events was not closed. Each vignette could select its\\nown particular set of buttons in the Command Window and its own particular set of menu items. Thus, the frame-\\nwork needed to marshal the events that were common to all vignettes, while allowing each vignette to override the\\ndefault processing; and it needed to allow for the vignette to marshal its own vignette-speciﬁc events. This was not\\nan easy task to accomplish.\\nAs an example, consider Figure 30-7. This diagram 6 shows a small portion of the ﬁnite state machine that\\nwould be used to marshal the events that occurred in the Command Window of a vignette. Each vignette had its\\nown special version of this ﬁnite state machine.\\nFigure 30-7 shows how three different kinds of events behaved. Let us ﬁrst consider the simplest case, the\\nScreenCursor event. This event was generated when the user clicked on the Change Cursor button. Each time\\nthe user clicked this button, the cursor in the Task Window would toggle between an arrow and a full-screen cross\\nhair. Thus, although the cursor changed state, no change of state occurred in the event processor. \\nWhen a user wants to delete an object he has drawn, he clicks on the Erase button. He then clicks on the item\\nor items in the Task Window that he wants to delete. Finally, he clicks again on the Erase button to commit the\\ndeletion. The state machine in Figure 30-7 shows how the Command Window event processor deals with this. The\\nﬁrst Erase event causes a transition from the Idle state to the Erasing state and starts up an Erase Task. We’ll\\nbe talking more about Tasks in the next section. For now, it is sufﬁcient that you know that the Erase Task will\\ndeal with any events that take place in the Task Window. \\nNotice that even in the Erasing state, the ScreenCursor event will still function properly and will not\\ninterfere with the erase operation. Notice also that there are two ways out of the Erasing state. If another Erase\\nevent occurs, then the Erase Task is ended, committing the erasure, and the state machine transitions back to the\\nidle state. This is the normal way to end the erase operation. \\n6.

But\\nany one of those implementations or marshallings can be overridden by the vignette.\\nTracing a Standard Event. Figure 30-9 shows how a standard event gets marshalled to the ﬁnite state\\nmachine and translated to a standard action. Message 1 is the Measure event. It comes from the GUI and is passed\\nto the VignetteCommandWindow. The default marshalling for this event is provided by the StandardCommand-\\nWindow, so it forwards the event to the StandardFSM in message 1.1.\\nStandardFSM is a framework class that provides an interface for all the incoming standard events and all\\nthe outgoing standard actions. None of these functions are implemented at this level. VignetteFSMContext adds\\ninterfaces, but no implementations, for vignette-speciﬁc events and actions. \\nThe real work of translating an event to an action takes place in the VignetteFSM and VignetteFSMState\\nclasses. VignetteFSM contains the implementations for all the event functions. So, the 1.1:Measure message\\ngets deployed down to this level. VignetteFSM responds by sending 1.1.1:Measure(this) to the Vignette-\\nFSMState object. \\nVignetteFSMState is an abstract class. There are derivatives of this class for each state of the ﬁnite-state\\nmachine. In Figure 30-9, we presume that the current state of the FSM is Idle. (See Figure 30-7.) Thus the\\n1.1.1:Measure(this) message gets deployed to the IdleState object. This object responds by sending two\\nmessages back to VignetteFSM. The ﬁrst is 1.1.1.1:SetState(ms), which changes the state of the FSM to\\nthe Measuring state. The second message is 1.1.1.2:MeasureTask(), which is the action required by the\\nMeasure event in the Idle state. \\nFigure 30-9 Processing the Measure Event\\nStandard FSM\\n+ Measure()\\n+ MeasureTask()\\nCommand\\nWindow\\n+ Measure()\\n+ MeasureTask()\\nVignette FSM\\nContext\\n+ SpecificTask()\\n+ Measure()\\n+ SpecificEvent()\\nStandard\\nCommand\\nWindow\\n+ Measure()\\nVignette FSM\\n«generated»\\n+ Measure(StandardFSM)\\nVignette FSM State\\n«generated»\\n+ SpecificEvent()\\n+ SpecificTask()\\n+ MeasureTask()\\n+ SpecificTask()\\n«generated»\\n1.1.1.2.1:MeasureTask()\\n1.1.1.1:SetState(ms)\\n1.1.1.2:MeasureTask()\\n1.1.1:Measure(this)\\n1:Measure\\n1.1:Measure\\n:IdleState\\n«generated»\\nms:\\nMeasuringState\\n:Vignette FSM\\nGlue\\n:Vignette\\nCommand\\nWindow\\n460\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

The window detects an event, passes\\nit to the FSM for translation to an action, and accepts the action back from the FSM. The rest of the complexity has\\nto do with separating standard actions known to the framework from speciﬁc actions known to the vignette.\\nAnother factor impinging on our decision to partition the classes as we did was our use of SMC to automati-\\ncally generate the ﬁnite-state machine classes. Consider the following description, and refer back to Figure 30-7:\\nIdle \\n{\\n  Measure Measuring MeasureTask\\n  Erase   Erasing   StartEraseTask\\n  Sketch  Idle      GetSketchChoice\\n}\\nNotice that this simple text describes all of the transitions that occur while the state machine is in the Idle\\nstate. The three lines in the braces identify the event that triggers the transition, the target state of the transition,\\nand the action performed by the transition.\\nSMC7 accepts text in this form and generates the classes denoted with «generated». The code generated by\\nSMC requires neither editing nor any inspection. \\nUsing SMC to generate the state machine makes the creation of this part of the event processor for a vignette\\nquite simple. The developer must write the VignetteCommandWindow with its corresponding implementations\\nfor speciﬁc events and actions. The developer must also write the VignetteFSMContext, which simply declares\\ninterfaces for the speciﬁc events and actions. And then the developer needs to write the VignetteFSMGlue class,\\nwhich simply dispatches actions back to VignetteCommandWindow. None of these tasks are particularly\\nchallenging.\\nThere is one other thing the developer must do. He must write the description of the ﬁnite-state machine for\\nSMC. This state machine is actually rather complicated. The diagram in Figure 30-7 doesn’t do it justice at all. A\\nreal vignette must deal with many dozens of different events, each of which can have remarkably different\\nbehaviors.\\nFortunately, most of the vignettes behave in roughly the same way. So we were able to use a standard state-\\nmachine description as a model and make relatively minor modiﬁcations to it for each vignette. Thus, each\\nvignette had its own FSM description. \\nThis approach is somewhat unsatisfying since the FSM description ﬁles were very similar. Indeed, there\\nwere several occasions when we were forced to change the generic state machine, which meant that we had to\\nmake identical or nearly identical changes in each of the FSM description ﬁles. This is both tedious and error\\nprone.\\nWe might have invented yet another scheme for separating the generic portion of the FSM description from\\nthe speciﬁc portion, but in the end we didn’t feel it was worth the effort. This is a decision we have chided our-\\nselves for more than once. \\nThe Taskmaster Architecture\\nWe have seen how events get converted into actions and how that conversion is dependent on a relatively complex\\nﬁnite-state machine. Now we are going to look at how the actions themselves are processed. It should come as no\\nsurprise that the core of each action is also driven by a ﬁnite state machine.\\nLet’s consider the MeasureTask that we discussed in the previous section. The user invokes this task when\\nhe wants to measure the distance between two points. Once invoked, the user clicks on a point in the TaskWindow.\\nA small cross hair will appear at that point.

GUI events that occur in the TaskWindow are routed to the task that is currently executing. Thus, when the\\nuser moves the mouse in the TaskWindow, the current task receives a MovePoint message. Notice that, in the\\nGetFirstPoint state, this does nothing (as expected).\\nWhen the user ﬁnally clicks in the TaskWindow, a GotPoint event occurs.This causes a transition to the\\nGetSecondPoint state and invokes the RecordStartPt action. This action will draw the ﬁrst cross hair and will\\nalso remember the location that the mouse was clicked as the starting point.\\nIn the GetSecondPoint state, a MovePoint event causes the Dragline action to be invoked. This action\\nsets XOR mode8 and draws a line from the remembered starting point to the current mouse location. It also com-\\nputes the distance between these two points and displays it in the message window.\\nMovePoint events occur frequently whenever the mouse is being moved over the TaskWindow, so the\\nmotion of the line, and the length displayed in the message window, will appear to continuously update as long as\\nthe mouse is in motion.\\nWhen the user clicks for the second time, we transition back to the GetFirstPoint state and invoke the\\nRecordEndPt action. This action turns off XOR mode, erases the line between the ﬁrst point and the current mouse\\nposition, draws a cross hair at the click point, and displays the distance between the starting point and the click\\npoint in the message window.\\nThis sequence of events repeats as long as the user desires. It only terminates when the task is cancelled by\\nthe CommandWindow, probably in response to the user clicking on a command button.\\nFigure 30-12 shows a somewhat more complex task—that of drawing a “two-point” box. A two-point box is\\na rectangle that is drawn on the screen with two clicks. The ﬁrst click anchors one corner of the box. A stretchable\\nbox then follows the mouse. When the user clicks for the second time, the box is made permanent.\\nFigure 30-11 Finite-State Machine for the Measure Task.\\n8. XOR mode is a mode in which the GUI can be placed.

Booch 94 was hailed as a strong design nota-\\ntion, whereas OMT was considered to be stronger as an analysis notation. \\nThis dichotomy is interesting. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, it was considered one of the advantages of\\nobject orientation that analysis and design could be represented by the same notation. Possibly, this was a reaction\\nto the strong separation between the notations for structured analysis and structured design. Crossing the chasm\\nfrom structured analysis to structured design was well known to be difﬁcult. \\nWhen object-oriented notations ﬁrst exploded upon the scene, it was felt that the same notation would serve\\nboth analysis and design. Yet as the decade progressed, analysts and designers began to migrate to their favorite\\nnotations. Analysts tended to favor OMT, and designers tended to favor Booch 94. Thus, it appeared that one nota-\\ntion would not really sufﬁce. A notation tuned for analysis was not appropriate for design, and vice versa.\\nThe UML is a single notation, but it has broad applicability. Parts of the notation are usable for analysis;\\nother parts are usable for design. Thus, both analysts and designers can use the UML.\\nIn this chapter, we will be presenting the UML notation from both views. First we will describe an analysis,\\nand then we will go on to describe a design. This description will take place in the form of a miniature case study. \\n1. [BOOCH94].\\n2. [RUMBAUGH91].\\n3.

See the “Course Enrollment System” sidebar.\\nCourse Enrollment System\\nUsers must be able to view a menu of the available course offerings and select the course in which they\\nwish to enroll. Once selected, a form should pop up that allows the user to enter the following\\ninformation:\\n•Name\\n•Phone number\\n•Fax number\\n•e-mail address\\nThere should be a way for the user to select the manner in which he wants to pay for the course. Those\\nmethods may be one of the following:\\n•Check\\n•Purchase order\\n•Credit card\\nIf the user wishes to pay by check, then the form should prompt him for the check number.\\nIf the user wishes to pay by credit card, then the form should prompt him for the credit card number,\\nexpiration date, and the name as it appears on the card.\\nIf the user wishes to pay by purchase order, then the form should prompt him for the purchase order\\nnumber (PO#), the name of the company, and the name and phone number of someone in the accounts\\npayable department.\\nOnce all this information has been ﬁlled out, the user will click on a ‘submit’ button. Another screen\\nwill pop up, which summarizes all the information that the user entered. It will instruct the user to\\nprint the screen, sign the printed copy, and fax it to the number of the enrollment center.\\nIt should also e-mail an enrollment summary to our enrollments clerk and to the user. \\nThe system will know the maximum number of students for each class, and will automatically mark\\nthe class offering as “Sold Out” once that limit has been hit.\\nThe enrollments clerk will be able to e-mail messages to all students enrolled in a given course by\\nbringing up a special form and selecting the course. This form will allow the clerk to type a message\\nand then hit a button that will send it to all students currently enrolled in the selected course.\\n(continues on next page)\\n468\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

One of the tasks of requirements analysis is to identify the actors and\\nuse cases. It should be noted that in a real system, these are not necessarily the ﬁrst tasks that are appropriate. But\\nfor the purposes of this chapter, they are where I choose to begin. In reality, the place you begin is less important\\nthan the act of beginning.\\nActors\\nActors are entities that interact with the system, but are outside the system. Often they are roles played by the users\\nof the system. Sometimes, however, they can be other systems. In this example, all the actors correspond to human\\nusers.\\nEnroller. This actor enrolls a student in a course. It interacts with the system to select the appropriate\\ncourse and enter the information about the student and the method of payment.\\nEnrollment Clerk. This actor receives e-mail notiﬁcation of each enrollment. It also sends e-mail notices\\nto students and receives reports about enrollments and payments\\nStudent. This actor receives e-mail conﬁrmation of enrollment and email notiﬁcations from the Enroll-\\nment Clerk. The Student attends the courses it is enrolled in.\\nUse Cases\\nHaving determined the actors, we specify the interactions of these actors with the system. These speciﬁcations are\\ncalled “use cases.” A use case describes the interaction between an actor and the system from the actor’s point of\\nview. None of the inner workings of the system are discussed, nor is the user interface described in any detail.\\nUse Case #1: View Menu of Courses.  The Enroller requests a list of courses\\nthat are currently available in the course catalog. The system displays the list of\\ncourses. Included in that list are the name, time, place, and cost of the course. The\\nlist will also show the number of students allowed in the course and whether or not\\nthe course is currently sold out.\\nUse Case Notation. The above diagram shows an actor and a use case within a use-case diagram. The\\nactor is the little stick ﬁgure, and the use-case is the ellipse. The two are bound together by an association that\\nshows the direction of the data ﬂow.\\nUse Case #2: Enroll in a course. The Enroller ﬁrst views the menu of courses\\n(Use Case #1). The Enroller selects a course for enrollment from the menu. The\\nsystem prompts the Enroller for the name, phone number, fax number, and email\\naddress of the student. The system also prompts the Enroller for the preferred pay-\\nment method.\\nExtension point: ﬁll out payment method\\nThe Enroller submits the enrollment form. The Student and the Enrollment Clerk\\nare sent email conﬁrming the enrollment. The Enroller is shown a conﬁrmation of\\nthe enrollment and is asked to print that conﬁrmation, sign it, and fax it to a spe-\\nciﬁc fax number.\\nThe enrollments clerk will also be able to bring up a form that shows the status of all students for\\nclasses that have already been taught. The status will indicate whether or not the student was in atten-\\ndance and whether or not the student’s payment has been received. This form can be brought up on a\\ncourse-by-course basis. Or the enrollments clerk can ask to see a list of all students who have out-\\nstanding balances.\\nView Menu of\\ncourses\\nEnroller\\nEnroll in a course\\nExtension Points:\\nfill out payment\\nmethod\\nView Menu of\\ncourses\\nEnroller\\nStudent Enrollment Clerk\\n«include»\\n469\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

Use Case #2 has an extension point. This means that other use cases\\nwill be extending this use case. The extending use cases are presented below as #2.1, #2.2, and #2.3. Their descrip-\\ntions are inserted into the previous use case at the extension point. They describe the optional data that need to be\\nentered depending on the selected payment method.\\nUse Case #2 also has a «include» relationship with Use Case #1, “View Menu of Courses.” This means that\\nthe description of Use Case #1 is inserted into the appropriate location of Use Case #2. \\nNote the difference between extending and including. When one use case includes another, the including use\\ncase references the included use case. However, when one use case extends another, neither use case refers to the\\nother. Instead, an extending use case is selected based upon context and is inserted into the extended use case at the\\nappropriate point.\\nWe use the «include» relationship when we want to make the structure of the use cases more efﬁcient by col-\\nlapsing repeated operations into smaller use cases that can be shared among many other use cases. The goal is to\\nmanage change and eliminate redundancy. By moving the common parts of many use cases into a single included\\nuse case, when the requirements of that common part change, only the single included use case must change. \\nWe use the «extend» relationship when we know that there are many alternatives or options within a use\\ncase. We separate the invariant part of the use case from the variable parts. The invariant part becomes the use case\\nthat is extended, and the variable parts become the extending use cases. The goal, once again, is change manage-\\nment. In the current example, if new payment options are added, new extending use cases will have to be created,\\nbut no existing use cases need to be modiﬁed.\\nNotation for the «include» Relationship. The diagram for Use Case #2 shows that the “Enroll in a\\nCourse” use case is bound to the “View Menu of Courses” use case by a dashed line that terminates in an open\\narrowhead. The arrowhead points at the included use case and has the stereotype «include».\\nUse Case #2.1: Pay by Purchase Order. The Enroller is prompted for\\nthe PO#, the name of the company, and the name and phone number of\\nsomeone in the accounts-payable department.\\nUse Case #2.2: Pay by Check.

The extending use cases shown above\\nare connected to the extended use case through «extend» relationships. This\\nrelationship is drawn as a line that connects the two use cases. Once again,\\ndashed, the line has an open arrowhead. The arrowhead points at the\\nextended use case and has the stereotype «extend». \\nUse Case #3: Email Messages to Students. The Enrollment Clerk selects\\na course and enters the text of a message. The system sends the message to\\nthe e-mail addresses of all the students currently enrolled in that class.\\nPay by Card\\nPay by\\nCheck\\nEnroll in a\\ncourse\\nEnroller\\nPay By PO\\n«extend»\\nemail\\nmessages to\\nstudents\\nEnrollment Clerk\\nStudent\\n470\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

Use-case diagrams, including system-boundary-diagrams, are\\nnot software-structure diagrams. They do not give us any information at all about the partitioning of the software\\nelements of the system to be created. These diagrams are used for human communication, primarily between the\\nanalysts and the stakeholders. They help to organize the functionality of the system in terms of the different kinds\\nof system users. \\nMoreover, these diagrams can be quite helpful when presenting the system description to the various kinds\\nof users. Each different kind of user is interested chieﬂy in his own use cases. The connection of the actors to the\\nuse cases serves to focus each different kind of user on the use cases that he or she will be using. In very large sys-\\ntems, you may wish to organize the system boundary diagrams according to actor type so that all different user\\ntypes can look at the subset of use cases that concerns them.\\nFinally, remember Martin’s ﬁrst law of documentation: Produce no document unless its need is immediate\\nand signiﬁcant.\\nThese diagrams can be useful, but they are often unnecessary. You should not think of them as required or\\nessential. If you have a need for them, then draw them. Otherwise, wait until you have a need.\\nThe Domain Model\\nThe domain model is a set of diagrams that helps to deﬁne the terms that appear in the use cases. These diagrams\\nshow the key objects within the problem and their interrelationships. Much pain and suffering have resulted from\\nthe tendency to assume that this model is also a model of the software to be built. It is important for both the ana-\\nlyst and the designer to realize that a domain model is a descriptive tool that is used to help humans record their\\ndecisions and communicate with each other. The objects in the domain model do not necessarily correspond to the\\nobject-oriented design of the software, nor would such a correspondence be a strong beneﬁt.5\\nIn Booch 94 and OMT, domain-model diagrams were indistinguishable from diagrams that represented soft-\\nware structure and design. In the worst cases, the domain model diagrams were taken to be high-level design doc-\\numents and were therefore used to set the high-level structure of the software itself. \\nTo help avoid this kind of mistake, we can take advantage of the features of UML and use a special kind of\\nentity called a «type» in domain models. A «type» represents a role that an object can play. A «type» can have\\noperations and attributes as well as associations with other «type» entities. However, a «type» does not represent a\\nclass or object in the design sense. It does not represent an element of software, and it does not map directly to\\ncode. It represents a conceptual entity used in the description of the problem.\\nThe Course Catalog. The ﬁrst domain abstraction we will consider is the course catalog. This\\nabstraction represents the list of all the courses that are offered. We show this in the domain model (see Fig-\\nure A-2) for the Course Catalog entity by depicting two entities that represent abstractions in the domain:\\nthe CourseCatalog entity and the Course entity. The CourseCatalog entity offers many Course entities.\\nDomain-Model Notation. The notation used in Figure A-2  depicts the two domain abstractions as\\nUML classes with the «type» stereotype. (See sidebar, “Overview of UML Class Notation and Semantics.”) This\\nindicates that the classes are conceptual elements of the problem domain and not directly related to software\\n5. [JACOBSON], p. 133, “We do not believe that the best (most stable) systems are built by only using objects that correspond to real-life \\nentities...”\\nAnd also on p. 167, “In [other] methods, this [domain] model will also form a base for the actual implementation; that is, the objects are \\ndirectly mapped onto classes during implementation. However, this is not the case in OOSE, [...]. Our experience with such an \\napproach tells us differently. Instead we develop an analysis model that is more robust and maintainable in the face of future changes \\nrather than using a problem domain model to serve as the base for design and implementation.\\n[BOOCH96], p. 108, “...there is a tendency in immature projects to consider the domain model resulting from analysis as ready to code \\n[...], thus skipping any further design. Healthy projects recognize that there is still quite some work to do, involving issues such as con-\\ncurrency, serialization, safety, distributions, and so on, and that the design model may end up looking quite different in a number of \\nsubtle ways.\\n472\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

Notice that the CourseCatalog entity has two operations: AddCourse and RemoveCourse. In a «type»,\\noperations correspond to responsibilities. Thus, the CourseCatalog has the responsibility to be able to add and\\nremove courses. Again, these are concepts, not the speciﬁcations of member functions within real classes. We use\\nthem to communicate with users, not to specify a software structure.\\nBy the same token, the attributes shown in the Course entity are concepts. They indicate that the Course\\nentity should be responsible to remember its fee, enrollment limit, and current enrollment. \\nFigure A-2 Domain model for the Course Catalog entity\\nOverview of UML Class Notation and Semantics \\nIn UML, a class is drawn as a rectangle with three compartments. The ﬁrst compartment speciﬁes the\\nname of the class. The second speciﬁes its attributes and the third its operations.\\nWithin the name compartment, the name can be modiﬁed by a stereotype and by properties. The ster-\\neotype appears above the name and is enclosed within guillemets (French quotation marks «»). Prop-\\nerties appear below and to the right of the name and are enclosed within braces. (See the following\\ndiagram.)\\nStereotypes are names that refer to the “kind” of UML class being represented. In UML, a class is sim-\\nply a named entity that can have attributes and operations. The default stereotype is «implementation\\nclass» in which case the UML class corresponds directly to the software notion of a class in a language\\nlike C++, Java, Smalltalk, or Eifel. The attributes correspond to member variables, and the operations\\ncorrespond to member functions. \\nHowever, with the stereotype of «type», a UML class does not correspond to a software entity at all.\\nRather it corresponds to a conceptual entity that exists in the problem domain. The attributes represent\\nthe information that logically belongs to that conceptual entity, and the operations represent the\\nresponsibilities of that conceptual entity.\\nThere are several other predeﬁned stereotypes that we will be discussing later in this chapter. You are\\nfree to create your own stereotypes, too. However, a stereotype is more than just a comment. It speci-\\nﬁes the way that all elements of a UML class should be interpreted.

I have been placing a lot of stress upon the\\ndifference between a class at the conceptual level (i.e., a «type») and a class at the design or implementation level.\\nI feel that this is appropriate because of the danger that conceptual diagrams might be mistaken as speciﬁcations\\nfor the structure and architecture of the software. Remember, conceptual diagrams are to help communications\\nwith the stakeholders and are therefore devoid of all the technical issues of software structure.\\nThe use of stereotypes to distinguish between these kinds of diagrams could be overlooked. UML classes for\\ndomain models look very much like UML classes for design and implementation. Fortunately, UML allows us to\\nsubstitute different icons for different stereotypes. Therefore, to further enhance the difference between these kinds\\nof diagrams, we will use a cloud icon to represent «type» classes from now on. This changes the domain model for\\nthe Course Catalog entity in Figure A-2 to look like Figure A-3.\\nCompleting the Domain Model. So far, the domain model shows a course catalog that contains all the\\noffered courses. But there is a problem here. What do we mean by a course? The same course can be offered at\\nmany different times and locations, and it can be taught by many different instructors. Clearly we need two dif-\\nferent entities. Let’s call the ﬁrst a Course. It represents the course itself, but not the dates, locations, or instruc-\\ntors. Let’s call the second a Session. It represents the date, location, or instructor for a speciﬁc course. (See\\nFigure A-4.)\\nNotation. The lines that connect the entities are called associations. All the associations in Figure A-4 are\\nnamed, although this is not a rule. Notice that the names are verbs or verb phrases. The little black triangle next to\\nthe name points at the predicate of the sentence formed by the two entities and the association. Thus, “Course Cat-\\nalog offers many Courses,” “Session Schedule schedules many Sessions,” and “Many students are enrolled in a\\nSession.” \\nI used the word “many” in the previous sentences wherever the “0..*” icon was present on the correspond-\\ning relationship. This icon is one of several different multiplicity icons that can be placed on the end of an associa-\\ntion. They indicate the number of entities that participate in the association. The default multiplicity is “1.” (See\\nthe sidebar entitled: “Multiplicities.”)\\nProperties are primarily structured comments. Properties are speciﬁed in a comma-separated list\\nbetween braces. Each property is a name = value pair separated by an equal sign (=). If the equal sign\\nis omitted, then the property is assumed boolean and given the value of “true.” Otherwise the type of\\nthe value is a string.\\nThere are several predeﬁned properties that we will be discussing later in this chapter. However, you\\nare free to add your own at any time. For example, you might create properties like this: {author=Rob-\\nert C. Martin, date=12/6/97, SPR=4033}\\nFigure A-3 Domain Model for Course Catalog using Cloud Icons\\nCourse Catalog\\nAddCourse\\nRemoveCourse\\noffers\\n0..n\\nCourse\\nfee : currency\\nenrollmentLimit\\ncurrentEnrollment\\n474\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

The enrollment and other forms would be accessed by a Web browser. The \\ndata would reside at the Web server, and CGI scripts would be invoked by the Web browser to access and \\nmanipulate the data.\\n2. A database application. We could purchase a relational database and use the forms package and 4GL to write \\nthe application.\\n3. Visual XXX. We could purchase a visual programming language. The human interface could be created \\nusing the visual construction tools. These tools would invoke the software functions needed to store, retrieve, \\nand manipulate the data.\\nThere are, of course, other options. We could write the whole thing in C without any library or tool support\\nother than the compiler. But this would be silly. The tools are there, and they work. We should use them.\\nFor the purposes of our example, we will assume a Web-based application. This makes sense since then\\nenrollers can be located anywhere in the world; and the enrollment service can be offered on the Internet.\\nWeb Architecture. We need to decide the overall architecture of the Web applications. How many Web\\npages will there be, and what CGI programs will they invoke?

We have\\nused the stereotype to specify the kind of components. The diagram shows that the Session Menu is displayed as\\nan HTML Web page that is generated by a CGI program called the Session Menu Generator. The dashed arrow\\nbetween the two components is a dependency relationship. Dependency relationships denote which components\\nhave knowledge of other components. In this case, the Session Menu Generator program creates the Session Menu\\nWeb page, and therefore has knowledge of it. The Session Menu Web page, on the other hand, has no knowledge\\nof the generator itself.\\nCustom Icons. There are two different kinds of components in Figure A-5.

Figure A-6 introduces two new Web pages and one new CGI program. We have\\ndecided that the application should begin with a banner page of some kind. Presumably, this page will have links\\nfor the various kinds of operations that users can perform. The Session Menu Generator is invoked by the banner\\npage and generates the Session Menu page. Presumably the Session Menu page has links or buttons that allow the\\nuser to enroll in a course. The Session Menu invokes the Enrollment Form Generator CGI to create the form nec-\\nessary for enrolling in the selected course. Once the user ﬁlls out this form, the Enroll CGI is invoked. This pro-\\ngram validates and records the information on the form. If the form data are invalid, it generates the Enrollment\\nError page; otherwise it generates the conﬁrmation page and sends the necessary e-mail messages. (Refer back to\\nUse Case #2.)\\nEnhancing Flexibility. The astute reader will have recognized that there is a rather nasty inﬂexibility\\nbuilt into this component model. The CGI programs generate most of the Web pages. This means that the HTML\\ntext within the Web pages must be contained within the CGI programs. This makes modifying the Web pages a\\nmatter of modifying and rebuilding the CGI programs. We would rather the bulk of the generated Web pages were\\ncreated with a nice HTML editor.\\nThus, the CGI programs should read in a template of the Web pages that they are going to generate. The tem-\\nplate should be marked with special ﬂags, which will be replaced with the HTML that the CGI programs must\\ngenerate. This means that the CGI programs share something in common. They all read template HTML ﬁles and\\nadd their own bits of HTML to them.6\\nFigure A-7 shows the resultant component diagram. Notice that I have added a WT icon. This represents an\\nHTML template. It is a text ﬁle in HTML format with the special marks that the CGI programs use as insert points\\nfor the HTML that they generate. Notice also the direction of the dependency relationships between the CGI pro-\\ngrams and the HTML templates. They might appear backwards to you. But remember they are dependency rela-\\ntionships, not data ﬂows. The CGI programs know about (depend on) the HTML templates.\\nFigure A-6 Enrollment Components\\n6. This chapter was written long before XSLT came on the scene. Nowadays, we’d likely solve the problem by having the CGI script s (or \\nservlets) generate XML and then invoke an XSLT script to translate that into HTML. On the other hand, generating HTML with XSLT \\nstill doesn’t give us the ability to design our Web pages with a nice WYSIWYG editor.

It is sufﬁcient that the object simply conform to the interface of the named class. In a static language like\\nC++, Java, or Eifel, the object should belong either to the class named in the sequence diagram or to a class that\\nderives from the class or interface in the sequence diagram. In dynamic languages like Smalltalk or Objective-C, it\\nis sufﬁcient that the object conform to the interface named in the sequence diagram.9\\nThus, the SessionSchedule object in Figure A-11 refers to an object whose class implements or derives\\nfrom the SessionSchedule interface.\\nStatic Model of the Session Menu Generator. The dynamic model shown in Figure A-11 implies the\\nstatic model shown in Figure A-12. Note that the relationships are all either dependencies or stereotyped associa-\\ntions. This is because none of the classes shown in the ﬁgure hold instance variables that refer to the others. All the\\nrelationships are transient in that they do not outlast the execution of the activation rectangle on the\\nSessionMenuGenerator lifeline of Figure A-11.\\n9. If you don’t understand this, don’t worry about it. In dynamic languages like Smalltalk and Objective-C, you can send any mes sage you \\nlike to any object you like. The compiler does not check to see whether the object can accept that message. If, at run time, a message is \\nsent to an object that does not recognize it, a run-time error will occur. Thus, it is possible for two completely different and unrelated \\nobjects to accept the same messages. Such objects are said to conform to the same interface.\\nFigure A-12 Static Model of the Session Menu Generator application\\nSession Menu\\nGenerator\\nIterator\\n<session>\\nHTMLTemplate\\nCourse Session\\n«instantiates» Session\\nSchedule\\n{singleton}\\n485\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

This denotes that only one\\nSessionSchedule object can exist within the application and that it is accessible at the global scope. (See S IN-\\nGLETON on page 178.)\\nThe dependency between SessionMenuGenerator and HTMLTemplate carries the stereotype «creates».\\nThis simply indicates that the SessionMenuGenerator instantiates HTMLTemplate instances.\\nThe associations with «parameter» stereotypes show that the objects ﬁnd out about each other through\\nmethod arguments or return values.\\nHow Does the SessionMenuGenerator Object Get Control? The activation rectangle on Session-\\nMenuGenerator’s lifeline in Figure A-11 does not show how it was started. Presumably, some higher level entity,\\nlike main(), called a method on SessionMenuGenerator. We might call this method Run(). This is interesting\\nbecause we have several other CGI programs to write, and they will all need to be started by main() somehow.\\nPerhaps there is a base class or interface called CGIProgram that deﬁnes the Run() method, and perhaps\\nSessionMenuGenerator derives from it.\\nGetting the User’s Input into the CGI Program. The CGIProgram class will help us with another\\nissue. CGI programs are typically invoked by a browser after the user has ﬁlled out a form on the browser screen.\\nThe data entered by the user are then passed to the main() function of the CGI program through standard input.\\nThus, main() could pass a reference to the standard input stream to the CGIProgram object, which would in turn\\nmake the data conveniently available to its derivatives.\\nWhat is the form of the data passed from the browser to the CGI program? It is a set of name-value pairs.\\nEach ﬁeld in the form that was ﬁlled out by the user is given a name. Conceptually, we would like the derivatives\\nof CGIProgram to be able to ask for the value of a particular ﬁeld by simply using its name. For example,\\nstring course = GetValue(“course”);\\nThus, main() creates the CGIProgram and primes it with the needed data by passing the standard input\\nstream into its constructor. The main() function then calls Run() on the CGIProgram, allowing it to begin. The\\nCGIProgram derivative calls GetValue(string) to access the data in the form.\\nBut this leaves us with a dilemma. We’d like to make the main() function generic, yet it must create the\\nappropriate derivative of CGIProgram and there are many such derivatives. How can we avoid having multiple\\nmain() functions?\\nWe can solve this by using link-time polymorphism. That is, we implement main() in the implementation\\nﬁle of the CGIProgram class (i.e., cgiProgram.cc). In the body of main(), we declare a global function named\\nCreateCGI. However, we do not implement the function. Rather, we will implement this function in the imple-\\nmentation ﬁle of the derivative of CGIProgram (e.g., sessionMenuGenerator.cc). (See Figure A-13.)\\nAuthors of CGI programs no longer need to write a main() program. Rather, in each derivative of\\nCGIProgram, they must supply the implementation for the global function CreateCGI. This function returns the\\nderivative back to main(), which can then manipulate it as necessary. \\nFigure A-13 shows how we use components with the «function» stereotype to represent free global func-\\ntions. The ﬁgure also demonstrates the use of properties to show what ﬁles the functions are implemented in.\\nNotice that the CreateCGI function is annotated with the property {file=sessionMenuGenerator.cc}.\\nSummary\\nIn this chapter, we have walked through a large portion of the UML notation in the context of a simple example.\\nWe have shown the various notational conventions used in the different phases of software development.

As a context for this exploration, we will study the problem of a statistical multiplexor.\\nThe Statistical Multiplexor Deﬁnition\\nA statistical multiplexor is a device that allows multiple serial data streams to be carried over a single telecommu-\\nnications line. Consider, for example, a device that contains a single 56K modem and has 16 serial ports. When\\ntwo such devices are connected together over a phone line, characters that are sent into port 1 on one device come\\nout of port 1 on the other device. Such a device can support 16 simultaneous full duplex communications sessions\\nover a single modem.\\nFigure B-1 shows a typical 1980s application for such a device. In Chicago, we have a mix of ASCII termi-\\nnals and printers that we want to connect to a V AX in Detroit. We have a leased 56K line that connects the two\\nlocations. The statistical multiplexor creates 16 virtual serial channels between the two locations.\\nFigure B-1 Typical Statistical Multiplexor Application\\n4X\\nASCII Printer\\nStatmux Leased line from\\nChicago to Detroit\\nMonitor\\nMonitor\\nMonitor\\nStatmux\\n16X\\nVAX\\nFrom Appendix B of Agile Software Development, Principles, Patterns, and Practices, First Edition.

However, most termi-\\nnals and printers are not busy 100% of the time. Indeed, the duty cycle in many applications is well under 10%.\\nThus, though the line is shared, statistically each user will perceive near 56K performance.\\nThe problem we are going to study in this chapter is the software inside the statmux. This software controls\\nthe modem and serial-port hardware. It also determines the multiplexing protocol used to share the communica-\\ntions line between all the serial ports. \\nThe Software Environment\\nFigure B-2 is a block diagram1 that shows where the software ﬁts in the statmux. It sits between the 16 serial ports\\nand the modem.\\nEach serial port generates two interrupts to the main processor—one when it is ready to send a character and\\none when a character has been received. The modem also generates similar interrupts. Thus, there are 34 interrupts\\ncoming into the system. The modem interrupts are higher priority than the serial-port interrupts. This ensures that\\nthe modem can run at the full 56K speed even if the other serial ports must suffer periods of dormancy.\\nFinally, there is a timer that generates an interrupt every millisecond. This timer allows the software to\\nschedule events for particular times.\\nThe Real-time Constraints\\nA little calculation will demonstrate the problem that this system faces. At any given time, 34 interrupts sources\\nmay be demanding service at a rate of 5600 interrupts per second—plus an extra thousand interrupts per second\\nfrom the timer. This amounts to 191,400 interrupts per second. Thus, the software can spend no more than 5.2 µs\\nservicing each interrupt. This is very tight, and we will need a reasonably fast processor to make sure that we don’t\\ndrop any characters.\\nTo make matters worse, the system has more work to do than simply servicing the interrupts. It also has to\\nmanage the communications protocol across the modem, gather the incoming characters from the serial ports, and\\ndivvy out the characters that need to be sent to the serial port. All of this is going to require some processing that\\nmust somehow ﬁt between the interrupts.\\nFortunately, the maximum sustained throughput of the system is only 11,200 characters per second (i.e., the\\nnumber of characters that can be simultaneously sent and received by the modem). This means that, on average,\\nwe have nearly 90 µs between characters.2\\n1. Block diagrams are a form of Kent Beck’s GML (galactic modeling language). GML diagrams are composed of lines, rectangles, ci r-\\ncles, ovals, and any other shape necessary to get the point across.\\nFigure B-2 Statmux system block diagram\\n2.

This means we don’t need to be overly concerned about efﬁciency\\noutside of the ISRs.\\nThe Input Interrupt Service Routine\\nThese may have to be written in assembly language. The prime goal of the input ISRs is to get the character from\\nthe hardware and store it somewhere where the non-ISR software can deal with it at its leisure. The typical way of\\ndealing with this is to use a ring buffer.\\nFigure B-3 presents a class diagram that shows the structure of the input ISRs and their ring buffers. We have\\ninvented a few new stereotypes and properties to describe the rather unique issues involved with interrupt service\\nroutines.\\nFirst we have the InputISR class. This class has the stereotype «ISR,» which indicates that the class is an\\ninterrupt service routine. Such classes are written in assembly language and have only one method. This method\\nhas no name and is invoked only when the interrupt occurs.\\nInputISR has an association to its particular RingBuffer. The «struct» stereotype on the RingBuffer\\nclass indicates that this is a class with no methods. It is nothing more than a data structure. We have done this\\nbecause we expect it to be accessed by assembly language functions that would not otherwise have access to the\\nmethods of a class.\\nThe Put(RingBuffer*, char) function is shown in a class icon with the stereotype of «reentrant». This\\nstereotype, used in this way, represents a free function that is written to be safe from interrupts.3 This function adds\\ncharacters to the ring buffer. It is called by InputISR when a character has been received.\\nThe properties on the function indicate that it has a real-time deadline of 2 µs, that it should be written in\\nassembly language, and that it should be coded inline wherever it is invoked. These last two properties are an\\nattempt to meet the ﬁrst. \\nThe ISRRingBuffer class is a regular class whose methods run outside of interrupt service routines. It\\nmakes use of the RingBuffer struct and provides a class facade for it. Its methods all conform to the «reentrant»\\nstereotype and are therefore interrupt safe.\\nThe ISRRingBuffer class realizes the Ring interface. This interface allows the clients outside the interrupt\\nservice routines to access the characters stored in the ring buffers. This class represents the interface boundary\\nbetween the interrupts and the rest of the system.\\nFigure B-3 The Input Service Interrupt Routine\\n3.

This rectangle may have two com-\\npartments. \\nThe top compartment simply names the state. If no name is speciﬁed, then the state is anonymous.

They are depicted in the icon\\nabove. The entry event occurs when the state is entered. The exit event occurs when the state is\\nexited (even for a transition that returns immediately to that state). \\nAn action may be the name of another ﬁnite-state machine that has both an initial and ﬁnal state. Or an\\naction can be a procedural expression written in some computer language or pseudocode. The proce-\\ndure may use operations and variables of the object, if any, that contain the state machine. Or, the\\naction can be of the form ^object.message(arg1, arg2, ...), in which case the action causes\\nthe named message to be sent to the named object.\\nThere are two special pseudostate icons shown in the previous diagram.

Transitions are arrows that con-\\nnect one state to another. The transition is labeled with the name of the event that triggers it.\\nHere we see two states connected by a single transition. The transition will be ‘ﬁred’ if the machine is\\nin state1 and the event occurs. Upon the ‘ﬁring’ of the transition, state1 is exited, and any exit\\naction is executed. Then the action on the transition is executed. Then state2 is entered, and its\\nentry action is executed.\\nAn event on a transition can be qualiﬁed with a guard condition. The transition will only ﬁre if the\\nevent occurs and the guard condition is true. Guard conditions are boolean expressions that appear in\\nsquare brackets after the event name (e.g., myEvent[myGuardCondition]).\\nActions on transitions are exactly the same as actions on internal transitions within states.

This will cause the entry functions of both S and C to be invoked. \\nIf transition Y ﬁres while in state A, the machine enters superstate S. A transition into a superstate must\\nresult in one of its substates becoming active. If a transition terminates at the edge of a superstate, as\\ntransition Y does, then there is a transition from the initial pseudostate within the superstate.

However, there are some\\ndifferences. The noninterrupt parts of the system load up the output ring buffer with characters to be sent. The\\nserial port generates an interrupt whenever it is ready for the next character. The interrupt service routine grabs the\\nnext character from the ring buffer and sends it to the serial port.\\nIf there are no characters waiting in the ring buffer when the serial port becomes ready, then the interrupt ser-\\nvice routine has nothing to do. The serial port has already signalled its readiness to accept a new character, and it\\nwill not do so again until it is given a character to send and ﬁnishes sending it. Thus, the ﬂow of interrupts stops.\\nWe therefore need a strategy for restarting the output interrupts when new characters arrive. Figure B-5 shows the\\nstructure of the output ISR. Its similarity to the input ISR in Figure B-3 is obvious. However, notice the «calls»\\ndependency from the ISRRingBuffer to the OutputISR. This indicates that the ISRRingBuffer object can\\ncause the OutpuISR to execute just as though an interrupt had been received. \\nFigure B-6 shows the necessary modiﬁcations to the ﬁnite-state machine of the output ring buffers. Compare\\nthis with Figure B4. Notice that the Puttable superstate has been removed and that there are two Put transitions.\\nThe ﬁrst Put transition goes from the Empty state to the Partial state. This will cause the entry action of the\\nGettable superstate to be executed, which generates an artiﬁcial interrupt to the OutputISR.4 The second Put\\ntransition is internal to the Partial state.\\nWhen transition Y is ﬁred, superstate S and substate C are both entered. Any entry actions for S and C\\nare invoked at that time. The superstate’s entry actions are invoked before the substate’s entry actions.\\nTransitions W and X may now ﬁre, moving the machine between the B and C substates. The exit and\\nentry actions will be performed as usual, but since superstate S is not exited, its exit functions will not\\nbe invoked.\\nEventually, transition Z will ﬁre. Notice that Z leaves the edge of the superstate. This means that,\\nregardless of whether substate B or C is active, transition Z moves the machine to state D. This is\\nequivalent to two separate transitions, one from C to D and the other from B to D, both labelled Z.\\nWhen Z ﬁres, the appropriate substate exit action is performed, and then the exit action for superstate\\nS is performed. Then D is entered, and its entry action is performed.\\nNotice that transition Q terminates on a ﬁnal pseudostate. If transition Q ﬁres, then superstate S termi-\\nnates. This will cause the unlabeled transition from S to A to ﬁre. Terminating the superstate also\\nresets any history information, as described later.\\nTransition T terminates on a special icon within the S superstate. This is called the history marker.\\nWhen transition T ﬁres, the substate that was last active within S becomes active again. Thus, if transi-\\ntion Z had occurred while C was active, then transition T will cause C to become active again.\\nIf transition T ﬁres when the history marker is inactive, then the unlabeled transition from the his-\\ntory marker to substate B ﬁres. This denotes a default when there is no history information avail-\\nable. The history marker is inactive if S has never been entered or just after S has been terminated\\nby transition Q.\\nThus the event sequence Y-Z-T will leave the machine in substate C. But both R-T and Y-W-Q-R-T\\nwill leave the machine in substate B.\\n4. The mechanism for generating an artificial interrupt of this kind is strongly dependent on the platform. On some machines, it  is possible \\nto simply call the ISR as though it were a function. Other machines require more elaborate protocols for artificially invoking ISRs. \\n495\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

Each sends packets to the other over a telecommunications line. We\\nmust assume that the line is imperfect and that errors and dropouts can occur.

The S variable contains the serial number that will be stamped on the next outgo-\\ning packet. Each packet is numbered with a serial number in the range 0..N. The sending thread will continue to\\nsend packets, without waiting for them to be acknowledged, until there are W outstanding unacknowledged pack-\\nets. W is set to N/2 so that never more than half the serial numbers are in play at any given time. The SendLimit\\nvariable normally holds the serial number of the packet that is beyond the window ( W), and so it is the smallest\\nserial number that cannot yet be sent.\\nAs the sending thread continues to send packets, it increments S modulo N. When S reaches the\\nSendingLimit, the thread blocks until SendingLimit is changed by the receiving thread. If S has not yet\\nreached the SendingLimit, then a new packet is pulled down from the queue by the ReadQueue() function. The\\npacket is placed in the S position of the P array.

A is the\\nserial number of the last packet that we received. This variable is updated by the receiving thread.\\nHaving sent the packet, we start a time-out for it. If this time-out occurs before the packet is acknowledged, the\\ntiming thread will assume that either the packet or the acknowledgment was lost, and it will retransmit the packet.\\nAt this point, we also reset the Ack timer.

This thread begins by initializing a few variables. RCVD is an array of boolean\\nﬂags indexed by serial number. As packets are received, they are marked in RCVD as true. Once a packet is pro-\\ncessed, the serial number that is W past that packet is marked false. E is the serial number of the packet we are\\nexpecting and is next to be processed; it will always be A+1 modulo N. As part of initialization, we set the last half\\nof RCVD to true to denote the fact that those serial numbers are outside the allowed window. If they were to be\\nreceived, they would be dropped as duplicate packets.\\nThe receiving thread waits for a frame. A frame may be a packet or just a plain acknowledgment. In either\\ncase, it will contain the acknowledgment of the last good packet. We update the SendingLimit and trigger the\\nsending thread. Notice that the SendingLimit is set to W past the last acknowledged frame. Thus, the sender is\\nallowed to use only half the serial number space starting at the last acknowledged packet, so that the sender and\\nreceiver have negotiated which half of the serial number space is currently valid.\\nIf the frame contains a packet, then we get the serial number of that packet and check the RCVD array to see\\nif we have already received a packet with this serial number. If so, we drop it as a duplicate. Otherwise, we update\\nthe RCVD array to show that the packet has now been received, and we save the packet in the R array. \\nAlthough the packets are sent in serial number order, they can be received out of order. This is true simply\\nbecause packets can get lost and retransmitted. Thus, even though we have just received packet number PS, it may\\nnot be the one we were expecting (E). If it is not, we simply wait until E is received. However, if PS == E, then we\\nspawn off a separate thread to process the packet. We also move the allowed serial number window by setting the\\nE+W slot of the RCVD array to false. Finally, we set A to E to signify that E was the last good received serial number,\\nand we increment E.\\nThe Timing Thread. The timer simply waits for a timer event. There are two kinds of events that can\\noccur. A Timeout(K) event signiﬁes that a packet was sent by the sending thread, but no acknowledgment was\\never received. Thus, the timer thread retransmits the K packet and restarts its timer. \\nThe AckTime event is generated by a repeating, retriggerable timer. This timer sends the AckTime event\\nevery X milliseconds. However, it can be retriggered to start over at X. The sending thread retriggers this timer\\nevery time it sends a packet. This is appropriate because each packet carries a piggyback acknowledgment. If no\\npacket has been sent for X milliseconds, then the AckTime event will occur, and the timer thread will send an\\nacknowledgment frame.\\nWhew! You may have found this discussion to be a bit of a struggle to get through. Just imagine what it\\nwould have been like without the explanatory text. The diagram may express my intent, but the extra words sure\\nhelp. Diagrams can seldom stand on their own.\\nHow do we know that the diagram is correct? We don’t! It won’t surprise me in the slightest if several read-\\ners ﬁnd problem with it. Diagrams can’t usually be tested directly the way code can. So we’ll have to wait for the\\ncode to know if this algorithm is really correct.\\nThese two issues make the utility of such diagrams questionable. They can make good pedagogical tools, but\\none should not be considered expressive and accurate enough to be the sole speciﬁcation of a design.

The CommunicationsProtocol has created two\\nThread objects and keeps responsibility for their lifetimes. The Thread objects employ the COMMAND6 pattern in\\norder for the newly created thread of execution to get started.

Meanwhile, a separate thread\\nof execution begins in message 1.4.1a, which invokes the Run method in the SenderRunAdapter. As a result, the\\nadapter sends message 1.4.1.1a: RunSendingThread to the CommunicationsProtocol object. This starts the\\nprocessing of the sending thread. A similar chain of events starts the receiving thread.

The messages that are sent between the objects are shown, along with their\\narguments and return values. Each message is labeled with a sequence number to show the order in\\nrelation to the other messages.\\nMessages are drawn as small arrows placed near the link between two objects. The arrow points at the\\nobject that is receiving the message. The message is labeled with the name and sequence number of\\nthe message.\\nThe sequence number is separated from the name of the message by a colon. The message name is fol-\\nlowed by parentheses that contain a comma-separated list of the arguments to the message. The\\nsequence number is a dot-separated list of numbers, followed by an optional thread identiﬁer.\\nThe numbers in the sequence number denote both the order of the message and its depth in the calling\\nhierarchy. Message number 1 is the ﬁrst message to be sent. If the procedure invoked by message 1\\ninvokes two other messages, they will be numbered 1.1 and 1.2, respectively. Once they return and\\nmessage number 1 completes, the next message will be number 2. By using this scheme of dots, it is\\npossible to completely describe the order and nesting of the messages.\\nThe thread identiﬁer is the name of the thread that the message is executing within. If the thread iden-\\ntiﬁer is omitted, it indicates that the message is executing in the unnamed thread. If message number\\n1.2 spawns a new thread named “t,” the ﬁrst message of that new thread will be numbered 1.2.1t.\\nReturn values and arguments can be shown by using the data token symbol (the little arrow with the\\ncircle on the end). Alternately, return values can be shown using assignment syntax in the message\\nname as follows:\\n1.2.3 : c:=message(a,b)\\nIn this case, the return value of “message” will be held in a variable named “c.” \\nA message that uses a ﬁlled arrowhead, as shown to the left, represents a synchronous func-\\ntion call. It does not return until all other synchronous messages invoked from its procedure\\nare returned. This is the normal kind of message for C++, Smalltalk, Eiffel, or Java, etc. \\nThe stick arrowhead shown to the left represents an asychronous message. Such a message\\nspawns a new thread of control to execute the invoked method and then returns immediately.\\nThus, the message returns before the method is executed.

The protocol, as described in Figure B-7, has a number of inter-\\nesting race conditions. A race condition occurs when the order of two separate events cannot be predicted, yet the\\nstate of the system is sensitive to that order. The state of the system then depends on which event wins the race.\\nThe programmer attempts to make sure that the system behaves properly regardless of the ordering of the\\nevents. However, race conditions are hard to identify. Undiscovered race conditions can lead to transient and\\ndifﬁcult-to-diagnose errors.\\nAs an example of a race condition, consider what happens when a packet is sent by the sending thread. (See\\nFigure B-10.) This kind of diagram is called a message sequence chart. (See “Message Sequence Charts” on\\npage 506.) The local sender sends packet S and starts a time-out. The remote receiver receives this packet and lets\\nthe remote sender know that S was received OK. The remote sender either sends an explicit ACK or piggybacks an\\nACK onto the next packet. The local receiver gets this ACK and kills the time-out.\\nSometimes the ACK doesn’t make it back. In that case the time-out expires, and the packet is retransmitted.\\nFigure B-11 shows what happens. \\nA race condition exists between these two extremes. It is possible that the timer will expire just as the ACK\\nis being sent. Figure B-12 shows the scenario. Note the crossed lines. They represent the race. Packet S has been\\nsent and received just ﬁne. Moreover, an ACK was transmitted back. However, the ACK arrived after the time-out\\nhad occurred. Thus, the packet gets retransmitted even though the ACK was received.\\nThe logic of Figure B-7 handles this race properly. The remote receiver will realize that the second arrival of\\npacket S is a duplicate and will discard it. \\nFigure B-10 Acknowledgment of a packet: Normal\\nFigure B-11 Acknowledgment lost: Retransmission\\nSet Timeout for S Packet(S)\\nAcK(S)\\n: Timer localSender localReceiver remoteSender remoteReceiver\\nKill Timeout for S\\nSet Timeout for S Packet(S)\\nPacket(S)\\n: Timer localSender localReceiver remoteSender remoteReceiver\\nTimeout\\nToo much\\ntime.\\n505\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir'),\n",

Others in the team just got back\\nfrom a ﬁve-day class on “catabolism” and have been pro-\\nducing incredibly detailed and arcane diagrams that\\nnobody else can fathom.\\nOn March 27, with one week to go before analysis\\nis to be complete, you have produced a sea of documents\\n“Jay, this is a new team, working on a new project.\\nIt’s a bit presumptuous to expect that our velocity\\nwill be the same as the previous team’s. However, I\\nmet with the team yesterday afternoon, and we all\\nagreed that our initial velocity should, in fact, be\\nset to ﬁfty story points for every three weeks. So\\nyou’ve lucked out on this one. ”\\n“Just remember, ” you continue, “that the\\nstory estimates and the velocity are very tentative\\nat this point. We’ll learn more when we plan the\\niteration and even more when we implement it. ”\\nJay looks over his glasses at you as if to say,\\n“Who’s the boss around here anyway?” Then he\\nsmiles and says, “Yeah, don’t worry, I know the\\ndrill by now. ”\\nJay then puts 15 more cards on the table. He\\nsays, “If we can get all these cards done by the end\\nof March, we can turn the system over to our beta\\ntest customers. And we’ll get good feedback from\\nthem. ” \\nYou reply, “OK, so we’ve got our ﬁrst itera-\\ntion deﬁned, and we have the stories for the next\\nthree iterations after that. These four iterations\\nwill make our ﬁrst release. ”\\n“So, ” says Jay, “Can you really do these ﬁve\\nstories in the next three weeks?”\\n“I don’t know for sure Jay, ” you reply, “Let’s\\nbreak them down into tasks and see what we get. ”\\nSo Jay, you, and your team spend the next\\nseveral hours taking each of the ﬁve stories that\\nJay chose for the ﬁrst iteration and breaking it\\ndown into small tasks. The developers quickly real-\\nize that some of the tasks can be shared between\\nstories and that other tasks have commonalities\\nthat can probably be taken advantage of. It is clear\\nthat potential designs are popping into the devel-\\nopers’ heads. From time to time, they form little\\ndiscussion knots and scribble UML diagrams on\\nsome cards.\\nSoon, the whiteboard is ﬁlled with the tasks\\nthat, once completed, will implement the ﬁve sto-\\nries for this iteration. You start the sign-up process\\nby saying, “OK, let’s sign up for these tasks. ”\\n“I’ll take the initial database generation, ”\\nsays Pete, “That’s what I did on the last project,\\nand this doesn’t look very different.

The\\nonly allowable activity is design. Now get back to it.”\\nSo, you and your team hack the design as best you\\ncan, unsure of whether the requirements have been prop-\\nerly analyzed or not. Of course it really doesn't matter\\nmuch since the requirements document is still thrashing\\nwith weekly revisions, and the marketing department still\\nrefuses to meet with you. \\nThe design is a nightmare. Your boss recently mis-\\nread a book named The Finish Line in which the author,\\nMark DeThomaso, blithely suggested that design docu-\\nments should be taken down to code-level detail.\\n“If we are going to be working at that level of\\ndetail,” you ask, “why don’t we just write the code\\ninstead?”\\n“Because then you wouldn’t be designing, of\\ncourse. And the only allowable activity in the design\\nphase is design!”\\n“Besides,” he continues, “we have just purchased a\\ncompany-wide license for Dandelion! This tool enables\\n“round-the-horn engineering!” You are to transfer all\\ndesign diagrams into this tool. It will automatically gen-\\nerate our code for us! It will also keep the design dia-\\ngrams in sync with the code!”\\nYour boss hands you a brightly colored, shrink-\\nwrapped box containing the Dandelion distribution. You\\naccept it numbly and shamble off to your cubicle. Twelve\\nhours, eight crashes, a disk reformatting, and eight shots\\nof 151 later, you ﬁnally have the tool installed on your\\nserver. You consider the week your team will lose while\\nattending Dandelion training. Then you smile and think,\\n“Any week I’m not here is a good week.”\\nDesign diagram after design diagram is created by\\nyour team. Dandelion makes it very hard to draw these\\ndiagrams. There are dozens and dozens of deeply nested\\ndialog boxes with funny text ﬁelds and check boxes that\\nmust all be ﬁlled in correctly. And then there’s the prob-\\nlem of moving classes between packages...\\nAt ﬁrst, these diagrams are driven from the use\\ncases. But the requirements are changing so often that\\nthe use cases rapidly become meaningless.\\nDebates rage about whether V ISITOR or D ECORA-\\nTOR design patterns should be employed. One developer\\nrefuses to use VISITOR in any form, claiming that it’s not\\na properly object-oriented construct. Another refuses to\\nuse multiple inheritance since it is the spawn of the devil.\\nAnd so, bit by bit, the list of tasks shrinks.\\nDevelopers who lose a task sign up for one of the\\nremaining ones. \\nThe negotiation is not painless. Several\\ntimes, Jay exhibits obvious frustration and impa-\\ntience. Once, when tensions are especially high,\\nElmo volunteers to “Work extra hard to make up\\nsome of the missing time. ” You are about to correct\\nhim when, fortunately, Joe looks him in the eye and\\nsays, “When once you proceed down the dark path,\\nforever will it dominate your destiny. ” \\nIn the end, an iteration acceptable to Jay is\\nreached. It’s not what Jay wanted. Indeed, it is sig-\\nniﬁcantly less. But it’s something the team feels\\nthat they can achieve in the next three weeks. And,\\nafter all, it still addresses the most important\\nthings that Jay wanted in the iteration.\\n“So, Jay, ” you say when things have quieted\\ndown a bit. “When can we expect acceptance tests\\nfrom you?”\\nJay sighs. This is the other side of the coin.\\nFor every story the development team implements,\\nJay must supply a suite of acceptance tests that\\nprove that they work. And the team needs these\\nlong before the end of the iteration, since they will\\ncertainly point out differences in the way Jay and\\nthe developers imagine the system’s behavior.\\n“I’ll get you some example test scripts\\ntoday, ” Jay promises. “I’ll add to them every day\\nafter that. You’ll have the entire suite by the middle\\nof the iteration. ”\\n~ ~ ~\\nThe iteration begins on Monday morning\\nwith a ﬂurry of CRC sessions. By midmorning, all\\nthe developers have assembled into pairs and are\\nrapidly coding away.\\n“And now, my young apprentice, ” Joe says to\\nElmo, “you shall learn the mysteries of test-ﬁrst\\ndesign!”\\n“Wow, that sounds pretty rad, ” Elmo replies.\\n“How do you do it?”\\nJoe beams.

Can you think of\\nsomething the code should do?”\\n“Sure. ” Elmo says with youthful assurance,\\n“First, it should connect to the database. ”\\n“And thereupon, what must needs be\\nrequired to connecteth the database?”\\n“You sure talk weird, ” laughs Elmo. “I think\\nwe’d have to get the database object from some\\nregistry and call the Connect() method. ”\\n“Ah. Astute young wizard. Thou perceivest\\ncorrectly that we requireth an object within which\\nwe can cacheth the database object. ”\\n“Is ‘cacheth’ really a word?”\\n“It is when I say it! So, what test can we\\nwrite that we know the database registry should\\npass?”\\nElmo sighs. He knows he’ll just have to play\\nalong. “We should be able to create a database\\nobject and pass it to the registry in a Store()\\nmethod. And then we should be able to pull it out of\\nthe registry with a Get() method and make sure\\nit’s the same object. ”\\n“Oh, well said, my prepubescent sprite!”\\n“Hey!”\\n“So, now, let’s write a test function that\\nproves your case. ”\\n“But shouldn’t we write the database object\\nand registry object ﬁrst?”\\n“Ah, you’ve much to learn my young, impa-\\ntient one.

Besides,\\nwho has time?\\nYour boss hires a consultant to build tools to count\\nthe number of lines of code that are being produced. He\\nputs a big thermometer graph on the wall with the num-\\nber 1,000,000 on the top. Every day he extends the red\\nline to show how many lines have been added. \\nThree days after the thermometer appears on the\\nwall, your boss stops you in the hall.  “That graph isn't\\ngrowing fast enough.

His points have grown again, and\\npart of a task, they integrate what they have with\\nthe rest of the system. Thus, the code base grows\\ndaily, and integration difﬁculties are minimized.\\nThe developers communicate with Jay on a\\ndaily basis. They go to him whenever they have a\\nquestion about the functionality of the system or\\nthe interpretation of an acceptance test case.\\nJay, good as his word, supplies the team with\\na steady stream of acceptance-test scripts. The\\nteam reads these carefully and thereby gains a\\nmuch better understanding of what Jay expects the\\nsystem to do.\\nBy the beginning of the second week, there is\\nenough functionality to demonstrate to Jay. Jay\\nwatchs eagerly as the demonstration passes test\\ncase after test case.\\n“This is really cool, ” Jay says as the demon-\\nstration ﬁnally ends. “But this doesn’t seem like\\none-third of the tasks. Is your velocity slower than\\nanticipated?”\\nYou grimace. You’ve been waiting for a good\\ntime to mention this to Jay, but now Jay is forcing\\nthe issue. \\n“Yes, unfortunately we are going slower than\\nwe had expected.

Team leaders, I want new estimates on my desk\\nin the morning. I am hereby mandating 65-hour work-\\nweeks until this project is complete. And it better be\\ncomplete by November 1.”\\nAs he leaves the conference room, he is heard to\\nmutter, “Empowerment—Bah!”\\n* * *\\nYour boss is bald; his points are mounted on BB's\\nwall. The ﬂuorescent lights reﬂecting off his pate\\nmomentarily dazzle you. \\n“Do you have anything to drink?” he asks. Having\\njust ﬁnished your last bottle of Boone's Farm, you pull a\\nbottle of Thunderbird from your bookshelf and pour it\\ninto his coffee mug. “What's it going to take to get this\\nproject done?” he asks.\\n“We need to freeze the requirements, analyze\\nthem, design them, and then implement them.” You say\\ncallously. \\n“By November 1?” your boss exclaims incredu-\\nlously. “No way! Just get back to coding the damned\\nthing.” He storms out, scratching his vacant head.\\nA few days later, you ﬁnd that your boss has been\\ntransferred to the corporate research division. Turnover\\nhas skyrocketed. Customers, informed at the last minute\\nthat their orders cannot be fulﬁlled on time, have begun\\nto cancel their orders. Marketing is reevaluating whether\\nor not this product aligns with the overall goals of the\\ncompany, etc., etc. Memos ﬂy, heads roll, policies\\nchange, and things are, overall, pretty grim.\\nFinally, by March, after far too many 65-hour\\nweeks, a very shaky version of the software is ready. In\\nthe ﬁeld, bug discovery rates are high, and the technical\\nsupport staff are at their wit's end trying to cope with the\\ncomplaints and demands of the irate customers. Nobody\\nis happy. \\nIn April, BB decides to buy his way out of the\\nproblem by licensing a product produced by Rupert\\nindustries and redistributing it. The customers are molli-\\nﬁed, the marketing folks are smug, and you are laid off.\\nIn March, there is a major demonstration of\\nthe system to the board of directors. The system is\\nvery limited and is not yet in a form good enough\\nto take to the trade show, but progress is steady,\\nand the board is reasonably impressed.\\nThe second release goes even smoother than\\nthe ﬁrst. By now, the team has ﬁgured out a way to\\nautomate Jay’s acceptance-test scripts. They have\\nalso refactored the design of the system to the point\\nwhere it is really easy to add new features and\\nchange old ones. \\nThe second release is done by the end of\\nJune and is taken to the trade show. It has less in it\\nthan Jay and Russ would have liked, but it does\\ndemonstrate the most important features of the sys-\\ntem. Though customers at the trade show notice\\nthat certain features are missing, overall they are\\nvery impressed. You, Russ, and Jay all return from\\nthe trade show with smiles on your faces. You all\\nfeel as though this project is a winner.\\nIndeed, many months later you are contacted\\nby Rufus, Inc. They had been working on a system\\nlike this for their internal operations. They have\\ncancelled the development of that system after a\\ndeath-march project and are negotiating to license\\nyour technology for their environment.\\nIndeed, things are looking up!\\n516\\nwww.EBooksWorld.ir\"),\n",

The ﬁrst variety was called “bounded” and was based on an array. The second was called “unbounded” and\\nwas based on a linked list.\\nThe constructor for BoundedSet speciﬁed the maximum number of elements the set could hold. The space\\nfor these elements was preallocated as an array within the BoundedSet. Thus, if the creation of the BoundedSet\\nsucceeded, we could be sure that it had enough memory. Since it was based on an array, it was very fast. There\\nwere no memory allocations performed during normal operation.

The Door alarms falsely.\\nWe can correct this situation by using the convention shown in Listing 12-3.

The execute method simply prints a character that was\\npassed at construction, checks the stop ﬂag, and, if not set, invokes delayAndRepeat. The delayAndRepeat\\nmethod constructs a SleepCommand, using the delay that was passed in at construction. It then inserts the\\nSleepCommand into the ActiveObjectEngine.\\nThe behavior of this Command is easy to predict. In effect, it hangs in a loop repeatedly typing a speciﬁed\\ncharacter and waiting for a speciﬁed delay. It exits the loop when the stop ﬂag is set.\\nThe main program of DelayedTyper starts several DelayedTyper instances going in the\\nActiveObjectEngine, each with its own character and delay. It then invokes a SleepCommand that will set the\\nstop ﬂag after a while. Running this program produces a simple string of 1’s, 3’s, 5’s and 7’s. Running it again'),\n",

The swap method swaps two adjacent cells\\nin the array.\\nThe sort method does not know about the array, nor does it care what kind of objects are stored in the array.\\nIt just calls outOfOrder for various indices into the array and determines whether those indices should be\\nswapped or not.

There are no perfect structures. There are only structures that try to balance the\\ncurrent costs and beneﬁts. Over time those structures must change as the requirements of the system change. The\\ntrick to managing that change is to keep the system as simple and ﬂexible as possible.\\nThe ADAPTER solution is simple and direct.

Most of the diagrams were produced after the code was complete.\\nIn 1998 neither Jim nor I had heard of Extreme Programming. So the design you see here was not conducted\\nin an environment of Pair-programming and test-driven development. However, Jim and I have always worked in a\\nhighly collaborative fashion. Together we would pore over the code he wrote, running it where feasible, making\\ndesign changes together, and then producing the UML and words in this chapter.\\nSo, although the design here is pre-XP, it was still created in a highly collaborative, code-centric way.\\nBibliography\\n1.

For example, suppose you have a hierarchy of Modem objects. The base class has the\\ngeneric methods common to all modems. The derivatives represent the drivers for many different modem manu-\\nfacturers and types. Suppose also that you have a requirement to add a new method, named configureForUnix,\\nto the hierarchy. This method will conﬁgure the modem to work with the UNIX operating system. It will do some-\\nthing different in each modem derivative, because each different modem has its own particular idiosyncrasies for\\nsetting its conﬁguration and dealing with UNIX. \\nUnfortunately, adding configureForUnix begs a terrible set of questions.
